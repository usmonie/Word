The imagination is part of the arsenal that actors draw from.|Bryan Cranston|Part, Draw, Arsenal 
'Castle' is a guy living in a fantasy world. He's in his imagination, writing these stories of murder.|Nathan Fillion|Writing, World, Fantasy 
I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually, I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid, too, and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me, a lot of passion for me. So to be comic-ized, yeah, that's cool.|Nathan Fillion|Day, Passion, Cool 
There's the argument that you can relate to someone who's completely unrelatable. In the way that a director shows you his imagination on a film, then I get to show you my imagination in a big dumb character.|Idris Elba|Character, Dumb, You 
I have always thought that the place where you sleep or the place you share with your partner should be separate from the place where you write. The domestic rituals and details somehow kill the imagination. They kill the demon in me.|Orhan Pamuk|Sleep, Details, Me 
Authoritarianism, an unrealistic occidental imagination - these issues will never be settled. Turkey will continue to take Europe as a model; it will continue to pursue its search for democracy.|Orhan Pamuk|Democracy, Search, Never 
The scientific imagination always restrains itself within the limits of probability.|Thomas Huxley|Limits, Always, Within 
It's amazing what you can do with an E in A-Level art, a twisted imagination and a chainsaw.|Damien Hirst|Art, Amazing, You 
Visualization - it's been huge for me. Your mind doesn't know the difference between imagination and reality. You can't always practice perfectly - my fingers will play a little bit out of tune, or my dance moves might not be as sharp - but in my mind, I can practice perfectly.|Lindsey Stirling|Dance, Reality, Mind 
The pleasures of the imagination are as it were only drawings and models which are played with by poor people who cannot afford the real thing.|Georg C. Lichtenberg|People, Real, Poor

I think imagination is a crazy thing, and that's what makes the world go around.|Shahid Khan|Crazy, World, Think 
New York, for decades, offered a perpetual series of 'golden ages' to artists. You constantly had to measure yourself against the best, and you had to watch them, which meant that your imagination and also your sense of what the market could stand got very, very sharp.|Margo Jefferson|Best, Yourself, New York 
There aren't any fences to the imagination, and so there shouldn't be any for books.|Matt Haig|Books, Any, Fences 
You always need that spark of imagination. Sometimes I'm midway through a book before it happens. However, I don't wait for the muse to descend, I sit down every day and I work when I'm not delivering lambs on the farm.|Barbara Kingsolver|Work, Day, Book 
We have to learn not to feel guilty about letting our imagination browse around, and you know, in writing fiction particularly. But I think, in any kind of writing, we have to learn to allow ourselves to approach it in a contemplative way.|Sue Monk Kidd|Writing, Know, Think 
I may have been sexy, but I was covered up total. There was something left to the imagination.|Suzi Quatro|Sexy, Up, May 
Most of the songs I write are just very directly from my life. I don't have a big imagination. Whenever I tried to write from fantasy, it comes out sounding really fake.|Rivers Cuomo|Life, My Life, Fake 
Everything you do on set is directly related to your imagination when you read the script for the first time.|Ewan McGregor|Time, You, First Time 
I'm not a passive person by any stretch of the imagination.|Courteney Cox|Stretch, Person, Passive 
Belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain.|David Hume|Alone, Belief, Nothing 
It's what you don't see that keeps you on the edge of your seat in any kind of film - leave it to the imagination of the viewer.|Christopher Lee|You, Kind, See 
Sometimes a character is really based on research that you do. Other times it's just based on your imagination or perhaps your conversation with the director. Or sometimes all of the above. It depends on the movie and character.|Joaquin Phoenix|Character, Research 
I guess I'm a very keen observer, and I'd like to think I have a good imagination.|Eric Bana|Good, Think, Like 
I feel like 'Amelie' is very much an extension of me. She's a contemporary woman who sees the world through her imagination.|Phillipa Soo|Woman, World, Me 
Everything is creative. It's all relative to me. No matter what, you've gotta use your imagination, use your senses.|Action Bronson|Creative, Me, You 
Theatre is about the collective imagination... Everything I use on-stage is driven by the subject matter and what you might call the text - but that text can be anything, from a fragment of movement or music to something you see on a TV.|Simon McBurney|Music, Theatre, You 
I remember the fact that milk was delivered every day by a milkman. In summer, my mother would make what now seem in my middle-aged imagination the most delicious iced milkshakes.|Simon McBurney|Day, Mother, Remember 
I made a real specific decision when I came out of school and most artists were writing about home - if you were a woman, you were writing about being a woman - and I decided not to do that, write about what you know. That's not what I do. I went as far away from home as possible in terms of the development of my imagination.|Anna Deavere Smith|Home, School, Woman 
Television contracts the imagination and radio expands it.|Terry Wogan|Television, Radio, Contracts 
I think because I try to keep things as real as I can, or I try to start from a place of reality, I almost don't have the imagination to write a book that's not set where I am.|Maria Semple|I Am, Book, Reality 
Some of us are interested in directors, but really the vast majority of us are interested in actors. You experience the films through the actors, so they're all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.|Danny Boyle|Experience, You, Fantasy 
You experience the films through the actors, so they're all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.|Danny Boyle|Experience, You, Fantasy 
The aspect of kind of living in your imagination and creating a more romantic vision of the world than the reality that you're given - that's definitely something I can sort of relate to.|Alden Ehrenreich|Romantic, Vision, World 
With any kind of sci-fi, the imagination continues, and the world exists, and you create that in your own mind, and it lives in you.|Scott Bakula|World, Mind, You 
My mother always cultivated my imagination from the time I was very little.|Alden Ehrenreich|Time, Mother, Little 
If you use your imagination, you can look at any actress and see her nude... I hope to make you use your imagination.|Hedy Lamarr|Hope, You, See 
I never played Freddy as real. In the true bible of Wes Craven's outline for the films, Freddy only manifests himself in dreams. And a lot goes into a dream, not the least of which is imagination. So Freddy is secondhand information. Freddy is an urban legend that's been handed down to these teenagers over the years.|Robert Englund|Dreams, Information, Bible 
I started track and field when I was 12 and didn't get to an Olympic Games until I was nearly 23. By any stretch of the imagination that's a very long apprenticeship.|Sebastian Coe|Long, Games, Started 
A man to carry on a successful business must have imagination. He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole thing.|Charles M. Schwab|Business, Man, Vision 
I saw that publishing all over the world was deeply constrained by self-censorship, economics and political censorship, while the military-industrial complex was growing at a tremendous rate, and the amount of information that it was collecting about all of us vastly exceeded the public imagination.|Julian Assange|World, Political, Economics 
Once you've got a child to the point that they've discovered books, they're safe. There's a world of the imagination that when they're hurt or upset, they can move into, and it is wonderful.|John Rhys-Davies|Child, World, Hurt 
I love sci-fi because it leads in the imagination, and I always say it has the most intelligent fans in the world.|Robert Carlyle|Love, World, Intelligent 
We didn't have all the distractions that young people have today. We didn't have these incredible computer games and social networks to engage with. I understand that. But once young readers do discover reading, when they discover a book which they fall in love with, it really unleashes something new in their imagination.|Mark Billingham|Love, Today, Reading 
A reader's own imagination is a far more powerful form of CGI than anything any movie can provide because it's unique. In your own imagination, you can enter all sorts of worlds, and they are unique to you because no other reader will interpret a book the same way.|Mark Billingham|Powerful, Book, Unique 
When France was the only reference for chefs to learn, you could go everywhere in the world, and they would copy dishes directly because they didn't have much expanded imagination or technique or knowledge.|Daniel Boulud|Knowledge, World, You 
The human imagination... has great difficulty in living strictly within the confines of a materialist practice or philosophy. It dreams, like a dog in its basket, of hares in the open.|John Berger|Dreams, Dog, Great 
You get your heart stomped by the opposite sex, and you're hurting so badly that you write 'Sometimes When We Touch.' But then what happens when you've been married for 25 years? You can't rely on those emotional male-female roller coasters. You have to start using your imagination and the powers of empathy more.|Dan Hill|Heart, Empathy, Start 
The more ships have grown in size and consequence, the more their place in our imagination has shrunk.|Rose George|Size, Place, Ships 
Never forget that the truest luxury is imagination, and that being a writer gives you the leeway to exploit all of the imagination's curious intricacies, to be what you were, what you are, what you will be, and what everyone else is or was or will be, too.|Andrew Solomon|Luxury, Never Forget, You 
I have a very vivid imagination.|Janice Dickinson|Very, Vivid 
You have to imagine it possible before you can see something. You can have the evidence right in front of you, but if you can't imagine something that has never existed before, it's impossible.|Rita Dove|Impossible, You, See 
Fools act on imagination without knowledge, pedants act on knowledge without imagination.|Alfred North Whitehead|Knowledge, Fools, Without 
I sometimes say that I don't make anything up - obviously that's not true. But I am uninterested in writers who say that everything comes out of the imagination. I would rather be in a room with someone who is telling the story of his life, which may be exaggerated and even have lies in it, but I want to hear the true story, essentially.|James Salter|Life, I Am, Want 
I have never been able to pay attention to anything for more than a few minutes - the stories in my head have always been so much more entertaining. Only books could pull me out of my own imagination, and then it was only to plunge me into someone else's.|W. Bruce Cameron|Me, Attention, Head 
For someone who writes fiction, in order to activate the imagination and the unconscious, it's essential to be free.|Manuel Puig|Free, Order, Someone

I just love music - by no stretch of the imagination am I professionally competent.|Vikram Seth|Love, Music, Just

I live in words. I like looking at things, but I don't have a strong visual imagination.|Colm Toibin|Strong, Words, Looking 
I think what's really the most ideal thing is for the player themselves, within their own imagination, to carve out what they view as being the essence of the character.|Shigeru Miyamoto|Character, View, Think 
Being an actor means asking people to look at you. I guess I accept that. But it's a profession in which the job is to show another world and other people. You may access it through bits of yourself, and your imagination and experience, but actually, in the end, you're not playing yourself.|Ralph Fiennes|Experience, Job, World 
I find Godzilla exciting because he/she/it comes from the sea. It's entirely plausible that it could be real. Yes it is! It doesn't take a huge stretch in the imagination to imagine that something may be living at the deepest depths of one of our oceans.|Rhys Darby|Sea, Living, Find 
Every time you get on a stage or in front of a camera, the whole exercise is about imagination. You're constantly depicting something that doesn't exist, and trying to find the reality of it. Once you settle on that premise, everything else is a matter of degrees.|Ron Perlman|Time, Reality, Exercise 
The Polar Express is about faith, and the power of imagination to sustain faith. It's also about the desire to reside in a world where magic can happen, the kind of world we all believed in as children, but one that disappears as we grow older.|Chris Van Allsburg|Children, Faith, Power 
The general effect of viewing 'Jumanji' is thrilling. I was able to see on film a thing that at one point had only existed in my imagination. I got to see the images from my book come alive.|Chris Van Allsburg|Book, See, Point 
There is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels for someone, for someone, pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echos.|Milan Kundera|Compassion, Pain, Nothing 
I enjoy working on a movie that lets your imagination run wild, it's great to be a part of and watch.|Chris Hemsworth|Great, Enjoy, Working 
When I was a teenager, reading for me was as normal, as unremarkable as eating or breathing. Reading gave flight to my imagination and strengthened my understanding of the world, the society I lived in, and myself. More importantly, reading was fun, a way to live more than one life as I immersed myself in each good book I read.|Malorie Blackman|Life, Good, Myself 
Cynicism and naivety lie cheek by jowl in the American imagination; if the United States is one of the most venal nations on Earth, it is also one of the most earnestly idealistic.|Terry Eagleton|American, Lie, Earth 
I have been afraid all my life that I am going to die. All my life it has been stuffed in my imagination.|Patty Duke|Life, I Am, My Life 
When I achieved the European record for reciting pi in 2004, this captured the imagination of Professor Simon Baron-Cohen in Cambridge, and he finally diagnosed me with Asperger's that year.|Daniel Tammet|Me, Year, Cambridge 
If when we are taught English we are just taught the rules of grammar, it would take all our love of our language away from us. What makes us love a subject like English is when we learn all these fantastic stories. Feeding the imagination is what makes a subject come alive.|Daniel Tammet|Love, Language, Rules 
I think most of the time you can make something happen, and it's about not letting your imagination be limited by that.|Jane Goldman|Time, Think, You 
Imagination is Reality Lite - a useful substitute when the real pleasure is inaccessible, too risky, or too much work.|Paul Bloom|Work, Reality, Pleasure 
Imagination tends to be truly useful if accompanied by the power of mental control - if the worlds in one's head can be purposefully manipulated and distinguished from the real one outside it.|Paul Bloom|Power, Control, Real 
I box two to three times a week. I don't like going to the gym because it's boring. I really like boxing because you have to combine concentration and imagination. I feel like I'm actually learning something that's useful.|Stephanie Sigman|Learning, Week, You 
People who don't see their nature and imagine they can practice thoughtlessness all the time are lairs and fools.|Bodhidharma|Nature, Time, People 
Toy Soldiers was my introduction to film. I certainly didn't think I was doing art by any stretch of the imagination.|Tim Robbins|Art, Doing, Think 
I can get very philosophical and ask the questions Keats was asking as a young guy. What are we here for? What's a soul? What's it all about? What is thinking about, imagination?|Jane Campion|Soul, Thinking, Questions 
There's no artist in this world that doesn't enjoy the dream that if they have bad reviews now, the story of Keats can redeem them, in their fantasy or imagination, in the future. I think Keats' poem 'Endymion' is a really difficult poem, and I'm not surprised that a lot of people pulled it apart in a way.|Jane Campion|Future, World, Artist 
I feel that directors at times are like the janitors on the set. I am the secretary, I am the organizer, I am the maid, and I ask if they have eaten or rested. The best things are always out of your control. It's those moments that surpass the imagination that are thrilling.|Jane Campion|Best, I Am, Moments 
God has given us an imagination, and our imagination is really the principle tool from which all creativity and artistry comes from.|Erwin McManus|Creativity, God, Tool 
You can have 10 bucks to 10 million bucks and if you got a crew, imagination and a lot of people willing to turn in some work next to nothing, you going to have a feature. But you can't get beyond how expensive marketing the movie is, it's so crushing.|Kevin Smith|Work, People, Marketing 
As an actor you have to have a strong vivid imagination as you're working and when the camera's rolling, but there's certainly a part of you that is aware of real life, that you're making a movie.|John Hawkes|Life, Strong, Camera 
For memory, we use our imagination. We take a few strands of real time and carry them with us, then like an oyster we create a pearl around them.|John Banville|Time, Memory, Real 
The first piece of music that captured my imagination was probably Ray Charles Live At Newport.|Van Morrison|Music, Live, First 
Learn to see things as they really are, not as we imagine they are.|Vernon Howard|Learn, See, Imagine

There's just so many great stories in the past that you can know a little bit about, but you can't know it all, and that's where imagination can work.|Geraldine Brooks|Work, Great, Past 
My greatest strength as a child, I realize now, was my imagination. While every other kid was reading and writing, I had seven whole hours a day to practice my imagination. When do you get that space in your life, ever?|Barbara Corcoran|Life, Strength, Space 
Writing is a mysterious process, and many ideas come from deep within the imagination, so it's very hard to say how characters come about. Mostly, they just happen.|Michelle Paver|Deep, Writing, Ideas 
All the best have something in common, a regard for reality, an agreement to its primacy over the imagination.|Wislawa Szymborska|Best, Reality, Agreement 
Politics is the enemy of the imagination.|Ian Mcewan|Politics, Enemy

For a 12-year-old with a hyperactive imagination who liked to dream of dreary gothic castles, suburban Florida felt a little stifling.|Ransom Riggs|Dream, Castles, Little 
My books are elegiac in the sense that they're odes to a nation that even I sometimes think may not exist anymore except in my memory and my imagination.|Richard Russo|Memory, Think, Nation 
All of the stuff I can't afford to do on a TV budget, I just put into the comic book because you're really only limited in a comic by your artist's imagination.|Marc Guggenheim|Book, Artist, Budget 
Any acting is a stretch of the imagination. That's your job. Acting is truth in imaginary circumstances. Acting with green screen or a motion capture stage, you're striving for absolute truth in absolutely imaginary circumstances.|Sam Worthington|Truth, Job, Green 
To me, stretching the capabilities of my imagination is a crucial aspect of writing fiction; you could think of it as a mental form of athleticism.|Julia Glass|Writing, Me, Think 
As a little girl, my destiny was stamped onto the canvas of my imagination at 5 years old. I was watching soaps with my grandmother... The most gorgeous black women I had ever seen in my life came out, and I knew that that is what I wanted to do - be fabulous and black and on TV.|Niecy Nash|Life, Women, Girl 
When you are a people's movement, you have one thing. Your only asset is people. And you have to deal with real people. Not the people of your imagination. Not the people you wish people would be. But people as they exist actually out there in the real world.|Norman Finkelstein|World, People, Wish 
Three centuries after the appearance of Franklin's 'Courant', it no longer requires a dystopic imagination to wonder who will have the dubious distinction of publishing America's last genuine newspaper. Few believe that newspapers in their current printed form will survive.|Eric Alterman|America, Believe, Three 
I guess just a lively imagination is the best effort an actor can have.|Jacki Weaver|Best, Effort, Actor 
There's something magical about a home run. It almost violates the space of the stadium. It's a game of the imagination in some ways. Baseball.|Alex Gibney|Home, Baseball, Space 
Radio listeners often have a very fertile imagination when it comes to body shape.|Tamsin Greig|Body, Radio, Shape 
I believed in myself. I never imagined myself as just an ordinary player.|Imran Khan|Myself, Never, Just 
If my accent betrayed my foreign birth, it also stamped me as an enemy, in the imagination of the producers.|Bela Lugosi|Me, Birth, Enemy 
I always won in my imagination. I always hit the game-winning shot, or I hit the free throw. Or if I missed, there was a lane violation, and I was given another one.|Mike Krzyzewski|Free, Always, Lane 
Imagination has a great deal to do with winning.|Mike Krzyzewski|Great, Winning, Great Deal 
To say that such-and-such a circumstance is 'Kafkaesque' is to admit to the denigration of an imagination that has burned a hole in what we take to be modernism - even in what we take to be the ordinary fabric and intent of language. Nothing is like 'The Hunger Artist.' Nothing is like 'The Metamorphosis.'|Cynthia Ozick|Language, Artist, Nothing 
I don't agree with the sentiment 'write what you know.'... I think one should write what one doesn't know. The world is bigger and wider and more complex than our small subjective selves. One should prod, goad the imagination.|Cynthia Ozick|World, Small, Know 
My children have been all over the world, and I think it's so good for them: expanding their horizons and imagination and seeing how other people live.|Keeley Hawes|Children, Good, World 
London has always provided the landscape for my imagination. It becomes a character - a living being - within each of my books.|Peter Ackroyd|Character, Landscape, Living 
I have always believed that the material world is governed by nonmaterial sources, so that in that sense 'English Music' is an exercise in the spiritual as well as the material. I have always been attracted to the Gothic and spiritual imagination, and I've always been interested in visionaries.|Peter Ackroyd|Music, Spiritual, World 
When I was a boy, I was a worrier, and so was my son, Joe. I used to tell him that worrying meant he had an imagination and that one day he'd be pleased.|Anthony Browne|Day, Son, Boy 
Inspiring passion in children for books, and the world of imagination and creativity fuelled by them, is a fundamental reason for why the Children's Laureate post exists.|Anthony Browne|Children, Creativity 
Picture books are for everybody at any age, not books to be left behind as we grow older. The best ones leave a tantalising gap between the pictures and the words, a gap that is filled by the reader's imagination, adding so much to the excitement of reading a book.|Anthony Browne|Age, Best, Words 
There's so much more that I want to do. Of course it's great what has happened so far: Ultra, Coachella, EDC. But still, production-wise and show-wise, I'd love to play a show at Madison Square Garden. Stuff like that is beyond my imagination.|Martin Garrix|Love, Great, Garden 
My daughter has a vivid imagination, and so does my son.|Nicole Ari Parker|Daughter, Son, Does 
Every parent knows this moment in a child's age when he or she needs your attention in a very specific way because it's the beginning and ending of the early life of imagination. It's such a responsibility.|Nicole Ari Parker|Life, Age, Responsibility 
I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life, and it's myself at eight. Because that's when the forces of imagination have the same value as the real world, when they're an instrument of survival: when my mother disappeared, and I imagined a mother. That was me at my best.|Henning Mankell|Life, Best, Mother 
Humiliating events have a way of capturing the public's imagination. So it has been since antiquity, when gladiators were pitted against each other and the legions of Spartacus were crucified in endless rows on the way to Rome.|Gary Weiss|Rome, Events, Way 
I became a novelist because of 'Gone With the Wind,' or more precisely, my mother raised me up to be a 'Southern' novelist, with a strong emphasis on the word 'Southern' because 'Gone With the Wind' set my mother's imagination ablaze when she was a young girl growing up in Atlanta.|Pat Conroy|Mother, Strong, Girl 
He who has imagination without learning has wings but no feet.|Joseph Joubert|Learning, Feet, Wings 
My approach as an actor has always been the same, in that the greatest gift that you're ever going to have is your imagination because you're not going to have all life experiences. So you draw on things that are sort of close to it but you spend your time expanding on it or drawing something specific on whatever your situation is.|Vince Vaughn|Life, Time, Gift 
I do as much comedy as I possibly can, but I'm basically limited by the imagination of the secretaries who make the decisions.|Rufus Sewell|Decisions, Comedy, Who 
Only World War II, which mobilized 10 million draftees, could by any stretch of the imagination be called a people's war.|John Gregory Dunne|War, World, People 
I've been working on the soprano saxophone for 40 years, and the possibilities are astounding. It's up to you, the only limit is the imagination.|Steve Lacy|Limit, Working, You 
I deeply adored my mum. She was an extraordinary person, even for the prejudice I'm likely to have. She was beautiful, amusing, a tremendous elaborator of things into comic proportions and extravagant in her imagination.|Andrew Motion|Beautiful, Prejudice, She 
I have an active imagination.|Anya Taylor-Joy|Active 
Reading changes your perspective and feeds your imagination.|Najat Vallaud-Belkacem|Reading, Changes 
I like to have a thing suggested rather than told in full. When every detail is given, the mind rests satisfied, and the imagination loses the desire to use its own wings.|Thomas Bailey Aldrich|Mind, Wings, Desire 
Dwellers by the sea are generally superstitious sailors always are. There is something in the illimitable expanse of sky and water that dilates the imagination.|Thomas Bailey Aldrich|Water, Sea, Sky 
To my mind the boy who gives least promise is one in whom the critical faculty develops in advance of the imagination.|Quintilian|Mind, Boy, Promise 
Life-writing calls for any number of dubious gifts: A touch of O.C.D., a lack of imagination, a large desk, neutrality of Swiss proportions, tactlessness, a high tolerance for archival dust. Most of all it calls for an act of displacement. 'To find your subject, you must in some sense lose yourself along the way,' is Richard Holmes's version.|Stacy Schiff|Yourself, Tolerance, You 
I ask questions. I watch the world. And what I have discovered is that the parts of my fiction that people most tell me are 'unbelievable' are those that are most closely based on the real, those least diluted by my imagination.|Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|World, Me, People 
I just can't afford to get bored, because if you've been blessed with a generous imagination, which a lot of actors have, to be engaged, to be stimulated, is to liberate your imagination.|John C. McGinley|Blessed, Bored, You 
To be in a show like 'Miranda' that captures everyone's imagination is amazing, but it's hard when people can't see beyond that. I started travelling to North America because 'Miranda' was so popular in the U.K.; I always knew I wanted to challenge myself and not go for the obvious roles.|Tom Ellis|Myself, Challenge, America 
Genius is an African who dreams up snow.|Vladimir Nabokov|Dreams, Genius, Snow 
I use a lot of film images, analogies, and imagination.|Carlos Fuentes|Film, Images, Lot 
I feel very giddy with the idea of making my imagination take form and being able to put on a show where people leave feeling like they've experienced something.|Carly Rae Jepsen|People, Feeling, Idea 
We are fascinated with our own history, and we are fascinated with the Romans because they were millennia ago, and yet they still capture our imagination because they were actually so similar to us. They were very civilized. They had a very similar political system.|Kit Harington|History, Political, Capture 
I write from my imagination, not from what I've read in books or seen on TV or to make money. I wrote from an idea I was passionate about.|Dirk Benedict|Money, Passionate, Idea 
They seem much rarer now, those auteur films that come out of a director's imagination and are elliptical and hermetic. All those films that got me into independent cinema when I was watching it seem thin on the ground.|Toby Jones|Me, Independent, Director 
The idea was always going to be that each year is a stand-alone story, which did make it easier on some level. It also requires the network to have the creative imagination to say, 'This is also 'Fargo,' you know what I mean?|Noah Hawley|Creative, Story, Know 
Meeting Australian mountaineer and author Tim Macartney-Snape when I was 16 in 1994 had a big impact on me. His ascent of Everest from sea to summit captured my imagination.|Tim Cope|Sea, Impact, Me 
An idea is a putting truth in check-mate.|Jose Ortega y Gasset|Truth, Idea, Putting 
The imagination is man's power over nature.|Wallace Stevens|Nature, Power, Man 
To regard the imagination as metaphysics is to think of it as part of life, and to think of it as part of life is to realize the extent of artifice. We live in the mind.|Wallace Stevens|Life, Mind, Live 
I'm an emotional sort of person in general and I have a vivid imagination, so I feel the whole spectrum of emotion strongly when I write.|Erin Morgenstern|Emotion, Emotional, Person 
My favorite literature to read is fairly dry history. I like the framework, and my imagination can do the rest.|Andrew Bird|History, Literature, Rest 
You have to just go with your imagination, where your instinct takes you.|Peter Mullan|You, Instinct, Where 
Your primary tools, as an actor, are observation and imagination. You can pretty much get everything you need from that, and you do. It brings back that element of pretend.|Stephen Lang|Tools, Observation, You 
On some level, acting is the art of pretend, and you have to have a highly cultivated sense of imagination. You have to be able to see things that aren't there, no matter what aspect of acting, whether it's green screen, whether it's on stage, whether it's anything else, whether you're working on the radio.|Stephen Lang|Art, Acting, Green 
The nomads' egalitarian lifestyle astonished the Greeks, who kept their own women indoors weaving and minding children. The exotic Scythian lifestyle fueled the Greek imagination and led to an outpouring of myths about fierce Amazons, 'the equals of men.'|Adrienne Mayor|Children, Women, Men 
We know their names: Hippolyta, Antiope, Thessalia. But they were long thought to be just travelers' tales or products of the Greek storytelling imagination. A lot of scholars still argue that. But archaeology has now proven without a doubt that there really were women fitting the description that the Greeks gave us of Amazons and warrior women.|Adrienne Mayor|Women, Thought, Warrior

Ideas control the world.|James A. Garfield|World, Ideas, Control 
In an era of parental paranoia, lawsuit mania and testing frenzy, we are failing to inspire our children's curiosity, creativity, and imagination. We are denying them opportunities to tinker, discover, and explore - in short, to play.|Darell Hammond|Children, Creativity, Short 
Ultimately, so much Dr. Seuss is about empowerment. He invites us to disappear into our imagination and then blows the doors off what that can mean.|Gary Ross|Doors, Empowerment, Mean 
Imagination creates some big monsters.|Olivier Martinez|Monsters, Big, Some 
A young imagination is bold, likes to make bigger leaps. It likes to, well, imagine that the dustbuster is a dinosaur; that the computer mouse is a hotrod; that the box is a cave; that the rawhide is a torch... or a baton... or something.|Mo Rocca|Bold, Young, Box 
I like to build a character, trying to stretch my imagination as far to the walls of my brain as I can to come up with something that feels truthful and feels real - as close to the skin as I can get it.|Uzo Aduba|Character, Brain, Trying

That was the appealing thing about comics: There literally is no budget in comics. You're only limited by your imagination.|Brian K. Vaughan|Budget, You, Comics 
Let's be clear - for people like me, who are obsessed with story and for whom words are their medium, writing is the best job possible. I work hard, but I earn more than the national average wage while I play with my imagination, and for me, that's a dream.|Sara Sheridan|Work, Best, Work Hard 
I used to write stories a lot because you had to fill your hours some other way than watching television. So my imagination was vivid, and I used to write a lot of stories. I wrote a novel, which I still have, which is so awful.|Robert Osborne|Television, Way, You 
Imagination is not the exclusive appanage of artists, but belongs in varying degrees to all men.|George Henry Lewes|Men, Artists, Belongs 
Philosophy and Art both render the invisible visible by imagination.|George Henry Lewes|Art, Philosophy, Invisible 
Clearly, some creative thinking is badly needed if humans are to have a future beyond Earth. Returning to the Moon may be worthy and attainable, but it fails to capture the public's imagination. What does get people excited is the prospect of a mission to Mars.|Paul Davies|Future, Thinking, Moon 
I feel like the Internet needs to be disarmed in some way. There needs to be a philosophical undermining of the Internet. We take it too seriously and too literally. For a reference we go to Wikipedia, which is full of inaccuracies and misinformation. It's kind of beautiful - it's all the product of imagination; it's not reality at all.|Sufjan Stevens|Beautiful, Reality, Internet 
When I start a picture, I always have a script, but I change it every day. I put in what occurs to me that day out of my imagination. You start on a voyage; you know where you will end up but not what will occur along the way. You want to be surprised.|Federico Fellini|Change, Day, Me 
You will obtain a vision of matter that is perhaps fatiguing for your imagination, but pure and stripped of what the requirements of life make you add to it in external perception.|Henri Bergson|Life, Vision, Perception

I am putting real plums into an imaginary cake.|Mary McCarthy|I Am, Cake, Real 
The violent quarrel between the abstractionists and the surrealists seems to me quite unnecessary.

From a very young age, stories fuelled my imagination in the most wonderful way.|Hayley Atwell|Age, Young, Way 
We are all afraid for our confidence, for the future, for the world. That is the nature of the human imagination. Yet every man, every civilization, has gone forward because of its engagement with what it has set itself to do.|Jacob Bronowski|Nature, Future, Confidence 
Predating the Internet and predating videos, you had an active imagination. You would hear sounds and then get mental pictures of what these sounds felt like to you. It engaged you and made you more invested in it. It made you want to get tickets to the show, buy the album, put the poster on the wall. Now it's sensory overload.|Q-Tip|Internet, Want, You 
I grew up in Sierra Leone, in a small village where as a boy my imagination was sparked by the oral tradition of storytelling. At a very young age I learned the importance of telling stories - I saw that stories are the most potent way of seeing anything we encounter in our lives, and how we can deal with living.|Ishmael Beah|Age, Small, Storytelling 
For imagination sets the goal picture which our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or fail to act, not because of will, as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination.|Maxwell Maltz|Goal, Picture, Fail 
Vision is the true creative rhythm.|Robert Delaunay|Vision, Creative, True 
Then I decided to draw from and on my own imagination, and everything came out perfect.|Jack Prelutsky|Perfect, Everything, My Own

Imagination is at the root of much that passes for love.|Gilbert Parker|Love, Root, Passes 
A person possessed with an idea cannot be reasoned with.|James Anthony Froude|Idea, Person, Cannot 
Writing for children isn't easy. Kids will abandon a story that doesn't interest, enchant, delight, thrill, or terrify them. But when you can find a way into a young reader's imagination through something as simple as words on paper, well, there's nothing more satisfying.|Kate Klise|Children, Simple, Words 
I've always had this in a kind of worst-case dark imagination. I want to know what the dark form in the window is. I want to know what the noise under the staircase is.|Lisa Unger|Window, Dark, Want 
I had been a reporter for 15 years when I set out to write my first novel. I knew how to research an article or profile a subject - skills that I assumed would be useless when it came to fiction.

No, no, I don't watch football. The last time I tried watching was the last Super Bowl. The problem I have is, you know, the graphic nature of my imagination; when I watch and see them meeting head onto head, helmet onto helmet, what flashes through my mind is what's going on in their brains. It's like torture to me.|Bennet Omalu|Nature, Time, Football 
I love using my imagination. I love writing about animals.|Mary Pope Osborne|Love, Writing, Animals

I have a darker imagination than most people.|Edan Lepucki|People, Most, Than 
Writers to some extent are childish, and it's at the childish level that one really engages with any experience. What really moves you is at the very personal, childish level of the imagination. My business is the imagination, and my imagination is engaged by Asia.|Christopher Koch|Business, Experience, You 
Each one seems to be, in some way, essentially different from the others, and each is a surprise to me. I think that making books, or any kind of art, might also be like mining.

I love the paranormal, because there, every genre I write can become one beacon for my imagination.|Leslie Banks|Love, Become, Beacon

Creative without strategy is called 'art.' Creative with strategy is called 'advertising.'|Jef I. Richards|Advertising, Creative 
I don't want life to imitate art. I want life to be art.|Ernst Fischer|Life, Want, Imitate 
Where there is no human connection, there is no compassion. Without compassion, then community, commitment, loving-kindness, human understanding, and peace all shrivel.

Art should be an oasis: a place or refuge from the hardness of life.|Fernando Botero|Life, Place, Oasis 
The walls between art and engineering exist only in our minds.|Theo Jansen|Engineering, Walls, Minds 
Because advertising and marketing is an art, the solution to each new problem or challenge should begin with a blank canvas and an open mind, not with the nervous borrowings of other people's mediocrities.

The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.|Marcus Aurelius|Life, Living, Wrestling 
The art of a people is a true mirror to their minds.|Jawaharlal Nehru|Mirror, People, True

There will be very few occasions when you are absolutely certain about anything. You will consistently be called upon to make decisions with limited information.

I never know what I'm going to put on the canvas. The canvas paints itself. I'm just the middleman.|Peter Max|Know, Canvas, Never

There are no rules. That is how art is born, how breakthroughs happen. Go against the rules or ignore the rules. That is what invention is about.|Helen Frankenthaler|Rules, Born, Ignore

Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art.|Frank Lloyd Wright|Work, Simplicity, Value

What art is, in reality, is this missing link, not the links which exist. It's not what you see that is art; art is the gap.|Marcel Duchamp|Reality, You, See 
To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event.|Henri Cartier-Bresson|Me, Photography, Event 
With just one polka dot, nothing can be achieved. In the universe, there is the sun, the moon, the earth, and hundreds of millions of stars. All of us live in the unfathomable mystery and infinitude of the universe. Pursuing 'philosophy of the universe' through art under such circumstances has led me to what I call 'stereotypical repetition.'|Yayoi Kusama|Stars, Moon, Mystery 
In art, at a certain level, there is no 'better than.' It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it. Trusting that, just because of the way people are built and how interconnected we are, greatness will translate and symmetry will be recognised.|Frank Ocean|Greatness, Yourself, People

Use the creative process - singing, writing, art, dance, whatever - to get to know yourself better.|Catie Curtis|Dance, Writing, Yourself

The word 'art' interests me very much. If it comes from Sanskrit, as I've heard, it signifies 'making.'

But we do not bring all this into politics... This is the difference between India and Pakistan.|Lal Bahadur Shastri|Unique, People, Country 
We all have our likes and our dislikes. But... when we're doing news - when we're doing the front-page news, not the back page, not the op-ed pages, but when we're doing the daily news, covering politics - it is our duty to be sure that we do not permit our prejudices to show. That is simply basic journalism.|Walter Cronkite|Daily, Journalism, Page

In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.|Franklin D. Roosevelt|Nothing, Way, You

But only 'rich' people by definition have the 'extra' money to buy things and invest to create economic growth.

Politics is the attempt to achieve power and prestige without merit.|P. J. O'Rourke|Power, Achieve, Without

I can tell you that too much money is corrupting American politics. Don't blame the American public.

The toughest thing to do in politics is to do the right thing when your supporters think the right thing is something else.|Pat Toomey|Do The Right Thing, Think

Those ideas have got to be heard.|Jeremy Corbyn|Ideas, Political, People 
Poetry is about the grief. Politics is about the grievance.|Robert Frost|Grief, Poetry, About

Like any young person who gets into a political campaign, I joined out of a highfalutin' desire to change the world. But you start to see the sort of tactics people use. You start to see politics not only in the macro but in the micro of the campaign itself. Some people get turned off by this side of it. Other people are drawn to it.|Beau Willimon|Change, Change The World 
One of biggest lies in politics is the lie that Republicans are the party of big business. Big business does great with big government. Big business is very happy to climb in bed with big government. Republicans are and should be the party of small business and of entrepreneurs.|Ted Cruz|Business, Happy, Great

It has been well said that a hungry man is more interested in four sandwiches than four freedoms.|Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Man, Hungry, Said 
I came back from university thinking I knew all about politics and racism, not knowing my dad had been one of the youngest-serving Labour councillors in the town and had refused to work in South Africa years ago because of the situation there. And he's never mentioned it - you just find out. That's a real man to me. A sleeping lion.|Johnny Vegas|Work, Racism, Man 
We can create a new kind of politics: kinder, more respectful, but courageous, too.|Jeremy Corbyn|Courageous, Kind, New 
Social media is natural to me, and it's a very immediate way of saying something. It's the way politics are done these days. In modern politics, you can't ignore that even if you wanted to. I can't imagine doing politics without it.|Nicola Sturgeon|Social Media, Media, Me 
My philosophy comes from a worldview that looks at the world as one. It's a holistic view that sees the world as interconnected and interdependent and integrated in so many different ways, which informs my politics.|Dennis Kucinich|World, Philosophy, View

Politics is for the present, but an equation is for eternity.|Albert Einstein|Present, Eternity, Equation 
One baby is a patient baby, and waits indefinitely until its mother is ready to feed it. The other baby is an impatient baby and cries lustily, screams and kicks and makes everybody unpleasant until it is fed. Well, we know perfectly well which baby is attended to first. That is the whole history of politics.|Emmeline Pankhurst|History, Mother, Baby 
In football, as in politics, resilience pays off.|George Osborne|Football, Resilience, Off 
I have certainly met much more discrimination in terms of being a woman than being black, in the field of politics.|Shirley Chisholm|Woman, Black, Discrimination 
To rely upon conviction, devotion, and other excellent spiritual qualities; that is not to be taken seriously in politics.|Vladimir Lenin|Spiritual, Seriously 
And it turns out that tribes, not money, not factories, that can change our world, that can change politics, that can align large numbers of people. Not because you force them to do something against their will. But because they wanted to connect.|Seth Godin|Change, Money, World 
If nominated, I will not run; if elected, I will not serve.|William Tecumseh Sherman|Run, Will, Serve

Politics is the most corrupt profession on Earth, no matter where you are.|Charles Dance|Earth, Matter, You

Politics I supposed to be the second-oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first.|Ronald Reagan|First, Realize, Profession

They say politics is a contact sport, and I have to agree with that.|Steve Largent|They Say, Say, Agree

At its worst, Washington is a place where name-calling partisan politics too often trumps policy.|Bernie Sanders|Worst, Place, Where

Politics has got too personal, too nasty, in Britain, as it has in America.|Dan Aykroyd|America, Nasty, Personal

I don't know what's more embarrassing, these musicians and actors talking about politics in interviews or the media actually giving them credibility about it.

Economics has become as riveting as politics.|Tina Brown|Economics, Become

The middle ground in Congress has all but disappeared. The founders intended competing principles and interests to check excesses and create a balance in our politics that would benefit 'we the people.'

Power in politics, sovereignty in America is with we the people, and that is the path to turning this country around: empowering the people.|Ted Cruz|Power, Path, America

Politics - I still think it's a bunch of liars and a bunch of self-interest. It's not about the people: it's about themselves and their rise to power.

I don't care what happens.'|Jay-Z|Time, Power, Support 
I never saw anything funnier than Texas politics.|Molly Ivins|Texas, Never, Anything

When politics is no longer a mission but a profession, politicians become more self-serving than public servants.|Emmanuel Macron|Mission, Politicians, Become 
I think people involved in politics make good actors. Acting and politics both involve fooling people. People like being fooled by actors.

If you're sort of interested in politics but sort of upset about contemporary politics, it's kind of wonderful to read about periods who were very eloquent and admirable - generally.

If I could be more vague I'd write more about people in my life, but I hate hurting feelings or making people feel uncomfortable. I've done that before. Unless they're sad songs. Those get finished fast, but the mean ones often end up at the back of the bottom drawer and it's probably for the best.|Caitlin Rose|Life, Best, Hate 
These days young kids don't have any place to form an epic adventure. It's more often in front of the TV screen or a laptop. That's very hard on them. They're being taught daily unsocial skills. Facebook is an unsocial skill. It's so sad.|John Lydon|Daily, Adventure, Skill 
I've always been fascinated by Elizabeth Taylor, and I had read that her first kiss happened on a film set, which actually made me a little sad. You need to have normal experiences of your own.|Emma Watson|Kiss, Me, You 
That's what is so great about being able to record a 13-song album. You can do a very eclectic group of songs. You do have some almost pop songs in there, but you do have your traditional country, story songs. You have your ballads, your happy songs, your sad songs, your love songs, and your feisty songs.|Reba McEntire|Love, Happy, Great 
There are receptors to these molecules in your immune system, in your gut and in your heart. So when you say, 'I have a gut feeling' or 'my heart is sad' or 'I am bursting with joy,' you're not speaking metaphorically. You're speaking literally.|Deepak Chopra|Heart, Joy, I Am 
Creation is a sustained period of bliss, even though the subject can still be very sad. Because there's the triumph of coming through and understanding that you have, and that you did it the way only you could do it. You didn't do it the way somebody told you to do it.|Alice Walker|Understanding, Triumph, You 
I feel that World Cup cricket should be played like football in which all the 160 countries take part. If only a handful of countries are going to keep on playing in the World Cup without making the game popular, I will be a sad man.|Kapil Dev|Football, Man, World

Don't eat because you're angry, bored, sad, or stressed.|John Rampton|Angry, You, Stressed 
To be honest, I'm a little upset these days. My family has been exposed to the media. Some people break into our house. My ex-girlfriend's photos are circulating online.

I eat my feelings - when I'm happy, when I'm sad.|Chrissy Metz|Happy, Feelings, Eat

When I do see a picture of myself that has been touched up too much, I do get a bit sad... it makes me look like a hypocrite. It breaks my heart. I would rather shoot a magazine and shoot my flaws, but that's not up to me.|Kendra Wilkinson|Myself, Heart, Me 
It is a historical error for those who were not there to just refer to August 28th as 'I Have a Dream' speech day. That is a real disservice to those who were there. It was a sad day. It was not a celebration environment.|Jesse Jackson|Day, Dream, Environment

I like to be sad once in a while. You need it for your equilibrium.|Marjane Satrapi|You, Need, Like 
I'm sad, upset, and disheartened with the trolling that happens on social media... At the end of the day, this whole homophobia is so disheartening and upsetting. And then they say, 'Why don't you speak about your sexuality? You could be iconic in this country.' But I don't want to be iconic anywhere. I want to live my life.|Karan Johar|Life, Day, Social Media 
Of course, you decide which story you want to tell. For me, it's been very authentic, so sometimes I'm super happy, and I post four pictures one after the other; sometimes I'm busy, and I don't. Sometimes I'm sad, and I post a sad picture.|Chiara Ferragni|Happy, Busy, Me

What makes me sad about school is that the people who are unhappy are unhappy because they don't believe it will change. And I just want to say: 'It does! High school ends and it's over.' I will tell anyone that it's OK to be unhappy at school, make lots of mistakes and then it will be over.|Alice Englert|Change, School, Mistakes 
It's the sad thing about entertainment: it's not always about who is the best. Jake The Snake had a horrible time playing politics. I never had a belt; didn't need one. They tried to put me against Hogan twice, but when the people chanted for me, when they chanted for the DDT, that was the end of that. They couldn't ruin their marketing.|Jake Roberts|Time, Best, Politics 
Corporate tax reform is nice in theory but tough in practice. It most likely requires lower tax rates and the closing of loopholes, which many companies are sure to fight. And whatever new, lower tax rate is determined, there will probably be another country willing to lower its rate further, creating a sad race to zero.|Andrew Ross Sorkin|Fight, Practice, Nice

Our generation, unfortunately, is stuck to our phones - and, like, Twitter - constantly, which I have no problem with. I'd say we're not describing the children of America or anything like that, but there is something to take from it: It is kind of sad how we can't go thirty minutes without checking our phone.|Israel Broussard|Children, America, Problem 
Sometimes I wonder if suicides aren't in fact sad guardians of the meaning of life.|Vaclav Havel|Life, Meaning Of Life 
I was such a sullen, angry, sad kid. I'm sure there are writers who have had happy childhoods, but what are you going to write about? No ghosts, no fear. I'm very happy that I had an unhappy and uncomfortable childhood.|Isabel Allende|Happy, Fear, Childhood

I've seen a couple white girls coming to my concerts wearing head wraps, and I think they look so cute. It's kind of sad to see that people are really into separation, trying to separate everybody and making a clear division of 'us against you,' even with fashion. That sucks. It's not the way the world is supposed to be.|Yuna|Cute, World, People

I was raised in an atmosphere of 'everything's fine.' But as I got older, I was like, 'Well no, everything's not fine. There is stuff that's sad.' I am a really sensitive person. I think I am too sensitive sometimes.|Ellen DeGeneres|I Am, Think, Person

Falling in love is awesome, but I'm never drawn to happy songs per se, so whenever you sit down to write a heartbreak song and you're happily in love, it's like, 'OK, now I have to go back to a sad place to get something good.'|Miranda Lambert|Love, Happy, Good 
I had often sought for the peace there is in Christ, but I could not seem to find the freedom I desired. A terrible sadness rested on my heart.

White|Freedom, Good, Peace

What if the Soviet intervention was a blessing in disguise? It saved the myth that if the Soviets were not to intervene, there would have been some flowering authentic democratic socialism and so on. I'm a little bit more of a pessimist there. I think that the Soviets - it's a very sad lesson - by their intervention, saved the myth.|Slavoj Zizek|Blessing, Socialism, Think

It's a sad indication of where Washington has come, where policy differences almost necessarily become questions of integrity.

One day, I was at my grandmother's house, and I found diaries that she kept as a young girl. I opened one to a page that had flowers glued inside.

My experience, with both my parents, is that grief has a lot of down, sad things, but I was also really emotionally raw, in the first year after each of them passed. Flowers smelled more intensely, my relationships were hotter, and I was more willing to risk. I was going for it a lot more. I was 'unsober' and I wasn't playing by my rules.|Mike Mills|Experience, Flowers, Parents 
I think I'm probably a very sad man wrapped in a very joyful package, and I think I'm very resilient, and I think I'm quite generous, sometimes to a fault. And I'm very bad with money, but I don't see that too much of a flaw.|Dave Matthews|Money, Man, Think 
Part of me is drawn to the nature of sadness because I think life is sad, and sadness is not something that should be avoided or denied. It's a fact of life, like contradictions are.|Robert Redford|Life, Nature, Sadness 
Whenever I'm sad, I just put on 'SpongeBob' and I cheer up.|Richard Harmon|Cheer, Up, Just

I think that's why you see so many Americans in Dublin look so sad: they are looking for the door through which they can begin to understand this place. I tell them, 'Go to the races.' I think it's the best place to start understanding the Irish.|Frank McCourt|Best, Door, Understanding 
I grew up feeling 'less than.' I was the sad, shy child hiding in the hall closet beneath coats. I'd wait for my grandmother's voice to call, 'Jewell, Jewell.' I was lost, waiting to be found. I thought being found, I'd be happier, better. All the while, I read stories. Stories with both truth and lies.|Jewell Parker Rhodes|Truth, Waiting, Child

I don't ever want to be sad about my life.|Tammy Duckworth|Life, My Life, Want 
It would be sad if the expertise built up during the 40 years of the U.S. and Russian manned programmes were allowed to dissipate.

The sad truth is that most of my husbands turned out to be convincing liars.|Joan Collins|Truth, Truth Is, Liars 
I'm incredibly sad that my mother's not here to see my kids and that my kids don't get to know her. And she didn't meet my husband. That's one of the hardest things. I don't even know how to put that into words.|Stella McCartney|Mother, Words, Husband 
Many marriages break up over hormonal imbalance, which is truly sad because it comes from a lack of understanding. When hormones are put back in balance with natural bioidentical hormones, a woman or man resumes their normal life of feeling good and having days filled with quality.|Suzanne Somers|Life, Good, Man 
When you're feeling down, sad, lonely, negative, you don't want to take care of yourself - and the weight problem and the diabetic problem and the heart attack and stroke problems and high cholesterol set in.|Richard Simmons|Heart, Yourself, Lonely

And both he and I became truck drivers for different companies.|Frank Gehry|Family, Time, Father 
One of the things psychologists used to say was that if you are depressed, anxious or angry, you couldn't be happy. Those were at opposite ends of a continuum.

What I find sad is that the New Age movement is primarily a commercial undertaking. But it is answering to a human need.|Laura Esquivel|Age, New, Human

If some people try to make a prenup into a pre-negotiation of a divorce... Well, that's really sad. But I do think that it's important to understand what each person has coming into the relationship, and what each person expects from the relationship.

I think that when you make yourself vulnerable, the thing that you do next is better. It's not like you have to inflict pain on yourself in order to make yourself better, but I think it helps.

Now it's digital.|Martin Scorsese|Digital, Doubt, Know

The sad fact is that spending rises every year, no matter what people want or say they want.|Ben Stein|People, Want, Matter

It's hard to tell what an entire series is going to be based on the first few episodes, or even on the first season. And it's sad because you see great casts and good ideas that don't get that opportunity to grow and show what it could turn into.|Kaley Cuoco|Good, Great, Opportunity

Nothing gets on other people's nerves at the office more than a whistler. And the sad part is, these whistlers don't know they're doing it. Someone should, tactfully, tell the whistler how much it disrupts the office environment.|Letitia Baldrige|People, Environment, Know 
Watching an entrepreneur fail is sad, but watching him fail from lack of nerve is tragic.|Steve Blank|Entrepreneur, Fail, Him 
The sad thing is that I feel so boring because 'Twilight' is literally how every conversation I have these days begins - whether it's someone I'm meeting for the first time or someone I just haven't seen in a while.

A lot of sad stories in a row - that wears on you.|Elizabeth Edwards|You, Stories, Lot 
I am pretty weird - as weird as in my videos. The only difference is Lilly is not a performer, and Superwoman is. So Superwoman is very fearless. You'll never see her nervous.

The sad fact is that it would be fair to say that United is a generic, bureaucratic, tired company. A sort of DMV in the sky. No real culture. No real strategy. No real expectations for employees or customers. All of which is a shame.|Patrick Lencioni|Culture, Sky, Company 
I certainly feel sad about the alienation from my son.|Harold Pinter|Son, Feel, Alienation 
I've cooked plenty of meals when I was sad, lonely, depressed, angry, bored, and/or under the weather. My primary aim in these circumstances is generally to cheer myself up, to fill my stomach with something warm so I can feel comforted and fed, usually just with a quick soup or an omelet.|Kate Christensen|Myself, Weather, Lonely 
Eating by myself in my own apartment, single and alone again for the first time in many years, I should have felt, but did not feel, sad.

Eating alone was freeing, too; I didn't have to make conversation.|Kate Christensen|Time, Myself, Alone

When people ask if I'm going to be sad that 'The Office' is over, they don't even understand the depth of that question for me. It's an era of my life. No one would have known my name if it wasn't for the show.|John Krasinski|Life, Me, People 
It doesn't hurt to feel sad from time to time.|Willie Nelson|Time, Hurt, Feel

A lot of country music is sad. I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times. It applies to music. Three chords and the truth - that's what a country song is. There is a lot of heartache in the world.|Willie Nelson|Music, Art, Truth

I'm convinced part of the reason I got signed is because of who I am, and it makes me sad.|Jeff Buckley|I Am, Me, Reason

You get people who come to London, sever links with where they come from, and then when they need people, there's nobody there. To feel like you can't go back home would be a horribly sad place to be, as is mistaking fame for genuine love and affection.|Johnny Vegas|Love, Home, People 
I don't have any problem with being the guy whose album people put on when they're feeling sad.|Sam Smith|People, Problem, Feeling

Ninety percent of people who lose weight gain it back. It's very sad.|Richard Simmons|People, Back, Lose

I actually get quite sad when I smell bacon.|Jane Velez-Mitchell|Smell, Bacon, Actually

Nixon has enough to overcome in terms of his legacy and his political history. Now he has to overcome the in-fighting between his daughters. It's so sad. There's another obstacle for him to clear.|Monica Crowley|History, Legacy, Political

Even when I wasn't playing, I always had a smile on my face because if I acted sad or mad, it wouldn't help me.|Henrikh Mkhitaryan|Smile, Me, Help

The best quality about Kobe Bryant? You want me to be honest? I don't know. I'll tell you why. I open my arms to everybody. But he never stepped forward for the embrace. So I never really got to know him. I don't know anything about him, and it's kinda sad.|Shaquille O'Neal|Best, Quality, Me 
There's a rule of writing: if everything is funny, nothing is funny; if everything is sad, nothing is sad. You want that contrast.|J. Michael Straczynski|Funny, Writing, Want

I don't think of my songs as sad songs. I think of them as vulnerable and honest. I crack jokes in between songs, so people don't leave feeling too dark.|Mary Lambert|People, Dark, Think 
I've never thought of my characters as being sad. On the contrary, they are full of life. They didn't choose tragedy. Tragedy chose them.|Juliette Binoche|Life, Thought, Tragedy

'Lord of the Rings' was my jam. I was so depressed when I realized that I couldn't live in Middle-earth. And I was so sad when I was eleven and didn't get a letter from Hogwarts saying that I was going to be a wizard!|Lucas Till|Live, Saying, Depressed 
Everyone finds my work super sad. I never do. I always find it uplifting in a weird way.|Jeff Lemire|Work, Weird, Find

Alison Carr on 'Homeland.' She was such great character to play, so clever and full of surprises. I was sad to see her go.|Miranda Otto|Character, Great, Play

The sad thing about any business I suppose, but in mine you see it particularly, is that you're always asked to do what you've already done.|Jeremy Irons|Business, You, See

Stories have always been the things that entertain me and make me feel happy and sad and move me and give me the experience of being able to live many lives in one lifetime. It's the best thing about being alive.|Michael Sheen|Happy, Best, Experience 
For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.|Michael Sheen|Funny, Death, Culture

I'm the only one in my family who is deaf, and there are still conversations that go around me that I miss out on. And I ask what's going on, and I have to ask to be included.

I would love to be married. But it's not a necessity like the way that I feel I need and want to have children. It would be wonderful to have a husband, and I would feel blessed to do it. But I would feel sad for the rest of my life if I had no kids.|Mindy Kaling|Love, Life, Children 
I write entirely in English; Tagalog chauvinists chide me for this. I feel no guilt in doing so. But I am sad that I cannot write in my native Ilokano. History demanded this; if it isn't English I am using now, I would most probably be writing in Spanish like Rizal, or even German or Japanese.|F. Sionil Jose|History, I Am, Writing

Being single is only sad if you have a problem with your own company. I'm content with mine.|Olga Kurylenko|Problem, Company, You

I'm so glad I spent 10 years being sad and lonely.|Caitlin Moran|Lonely, Years, Being

I'm sad I'm not in 'The Purge 2.'|Lena Headey|Purge 
A lot of my movies have come to be thought about only years after the fact, and I'm sad about that but also happy about it in a way, as it's given them longevity.|Nicolas Roeg|Happy, Thought, Movies 
I survived turning 60, I was not thrilled to turn 61, I was less thrilled to turn 62, I didn't much like being 63, I loathed being 64, and I will hate being 65. I don't let on about such things in person; in person, I am cheerful and Pollyanna-ish. But the honest truth is that it's sad to be over 60.|Nora Ephron|Truth, I Am, Hate 
Atari is a very sad story.|Steve Wozniak|Story, Very, Atari 
I always feel sad when I come to the end of a book.|Claire Tomalin|Book, End, Feel

Saturdays and Sundays, America in the year 2009 does not in some ways differ significantly from the country that existed almost 50 years ago. This is truly sad.|Eric Holder|America, Country, Years

The big thing for me is to make films that you feel, whether you feel happy, whether you feel sad, whether you feel sick; it's to make the audience feel so that the next day they remember what they saw.|Asif Kapadia|Happy, Day, Me

There is something sad about malevolence, to be wicked. I have always tried to make that come across in the villains I have played.|Christopher Lee|Always, Something, Wicked

With my schedule being so crazy, I can't call every day or hang out with my friends like I used to and that's definitely sad.|Jordin Sparks|Day, Friends, Crazy 
I love books; my suitcases are always full of them. Books and shoes. I read when I am sad, when I am happy, when I am nervous. My favourite British author is Jane Austen, and my favourite American one is John O'Hara.|Carolina Herrera|Love, Happy, Shoes 
We all suffer in our own way; like, life is miserable. And I'm not, 'Oh, I'm a stand-up who's sad,' but the reality is that just about everyone is quietly unhappy. I don't think that pertains to comedians specifically. I think most people look at themselves in the mirror and are not happy with what they see.|Nick Kroll|Life, Happy, Mirror 
I find Spike Jones' movies to be really very inventive and funny, but they're really sad and touching and really key into the different facets of the human experience.|Nick Kroll|Funny, Experience, Movies

When I remember my mother, it makes me really sad. But, when I remember my father, it makes me smile.|Akkineni Nagarjuna|Smile, Father, Mother 
Hollywood is like a really sad, grown up version of high school where people get labeled as 'cool,' 'not cool,' 'jock,' 'bombshell,' 'quirky'... it's like a caste system. You're either in, or you're out.|Zoe Kravitz|School, Cool, People 
You have to keep hobbies in L.A. Otherwise, it's sad.|Lake Bell|You, Hobbies, Keep 
What I think is sad about the rom-com genre is that it has adopted this pejorative title. I think the reason why there haven't been as many great ones is because we are fighting against the genre itself. If it is a romantic comedy then snuggle up to the fact that it can be a really earnest, refreshing feeling to feel good after a movie.|Lake Bell|Romantic, Good, Great 
I never get scared making these kinds of movies because it's all make-believe, but I did cry when I saw the finished version of Man On Fire because it is so sad.|Dakota Fanning|Man, Fire, Movies 
The hardest thing is at the end you have to say bye to all these people who you have worked with for so many months. It was really sad not to see them anymore. But you have the parties that you go to and you get to see them, like the premieres and the screenings.|Dakota Fanning|End, People, You 
I like everything perfect. Everything has to be neat. My sister is 5, and she's more messy than I am. I make my bed every morning, everything's perfect. My shoes are all arranged. It's sad. I'm a little like Ray, a little bit.|Dakota Fanning|Morning, Sister, Shoes 
I grew up thinking that it's okay to be sad, angry, and express your emotions. I have also banged doors and fought, as I have seen my mom do that when she would fight with my dad. Everything that I've learnt is from them, so I've never struggled to express myself.|Alia Bhatt|Myself, Mom, Thinking 
I don't know who would not classify themselves as a romantic. I think that would be sort of sad.|Natalie Portman|Romantic, Know, Think 
I'm very artistic and creative, disorganised - ambitious, I would say, if that even makes sense. I'm definitely not the most mathematical person in the world; not scientific. I can't even work out a tip; it's really sad. But I've always thought, play up your strengths and let someone else handle your weaknesses. It's OK. Work together.|Whitney Wolfe|Work, Together, World 
I know a lot of sad people who aren't comedians.|Gene Wilder|People, Know, Comedians

I don't really do sad, depressing songs.|Olly Murs|Depressing, Songs, Really 
If people are paying money to see me, then I want them to walk away from the show knowing they had a really great time. I want it to be very energetic and to have fun, sad, emotional and uplifting moments. I want it to have everything!|Olly Murs|Time, Money, Great 
I'm not going to do a song that's really sad and thoughtful. Although I've done ballads like 'Dear Darlin',' I want to make them dance and be happy.|Olly Murs|Happy, Dance, Be Happy 
I've always been drawn to Marilyn Monroe, but certain aspects of her story may be too sad to tell.|Sherilyn Fenn|Story, Her, Always 
I've worked with some people that just spent hours and hours and hours in the mirror, and just so much importance is based on that. And I do find that sad.|Sherilyn Fenn|Mirror, People, Find 
For whatever reason, the films I gravitate towards do have these strange sort of tonal balances to them... I kind of realized on '50/ 50' why I liked these blending of tones, because I think it's kind of what life is like: funny one minute, sad the next, scary the next.|Jonathan Levine|Funny, Life, Think 
I am very sad that some designers are still using real fur when the fake alternatives are so effective and so easily obtainable.|Twiggy|I Am, Fake, Real 
I was at the Olympic Games winning medals and I still doubted my image. I doubted what I looked like. That's sad.|Shawn Johnson|Winning, Like, Games

Football is a sad game.|George Best|Football, Game 
It's a sad thing to contemplate, but I'm the last surviving cast member of 'The African Queen.'|Theodore Bikel|Queen, Surviving, Last 
Chocolate is the go-to ingredient for many people. It is the thing people crave when they are happy and celebrate it is also the go-to ingredient for many people when we are sad or depressed. It makes us feel better. |Johnny Iuzzini|Happy, Celebrate, People

I guess it's sad that anybody, regardless of profession, that they're in this country, would take a shot at our military.|Jeff Fisher|Military, Country 
You start to fall in love with characters as you work with them, and anytime that you care about your characters and you realize that you're gonna have to kill them, that fear creeps in. It's sad. It's scary, and it's also sad. Because you like these people.|Drew Goddard|Love, Work, Fear 
My father's death, my move, and my frightening and difficult delivery created a tremendous amount of stress, pain, and sadness for me. I was practically devastated beyond recovery.|Brooke Shields|Death, Father, Stress

I've met so many fans of daytime television who've watched the shows with their moms and grandmas and feel like they've known the characters their whole lives.

Nobody wants to hear R&B. It's sad. If you want to be on the radio you got to stay young.|Jamie Foxx|Want, Young, You 
It feels really sad, to me, to go to a dark bedroom. It's like surrendering to the night or something.|James Franco|Night, Me, Dark 
The 2012 presidential campaign's turn away from the classic, straight-up, American election - where the candidate who gets the most votes nationwide wins - is another sad reminder of the extreme political polarization distorting today's politics. No one talks about a 50-state strategy for winning the presidency these days.|Juan Williams|Today, Winning, Politics 
So many schools are getting rid of music programs and it's really sad because I know that when I started singing and stuff it was something that I always wanted to do and I never believed in myself to be able to do it.|Hilary Duff|Music, Myself, Singing 
Marketing has supplanted story as the primary force behind the worthiness of making a film, and that's a very sad thing.

Nobody destroys people - people destroy themselves, and it's very, very sad.|John Catsimatidis|People, Nobody, Destroy

It's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. And - and that has put our national security at risk.|Scott Walker|Government, Risk, Know 
I think my thing is that... I don't know. And that's why I don't wanna sing about 'This is me, this is who I am' because, like, even the question, 'Tell me about yourself' - what are you supposed to say? 'Ooh, I'm a happy girl, but I'm sad, too'? People are so complex.|Zara Larsson|Happy, I Am, Girl 
It's incredible that they censor films. It's sad.|Dario Argento|Incredible, Censor, Films

I think that's very sad, that I haven't allowed my heart to be broken. I have broken a few.|Sally Field|Heart, Broken, Think

Dwight is a sad clown. You've seen those paintings of sad clown.|Rainn Wilson|Clown, You, Seen

It's sad when people break up.|Pete Townshend|People, Up, Break 
Women get the attention when we get into the men's arena, and that's sad.|Billie Jean King|Women, Men, Attention

I think everyone feels alone in their sadness, and there's a certain value to hearing other people's sad stories.|Brandon Stanton|Alone, Sadness, Value 
It is a sad day for our country when the moral foundation of our law and the acknowledgment of God has to be hidden from public view to appease a federal judge.|Soledad O'Brien|Day, God, Law 
Women are reputed never to be disgusted. The sad fact is that they often are, but not with men; following the lead of men, they are most often disgusted with themselves.|Germaine Greer|Women, Men, Lead 
I got interested in reading very early, because a story was read to me, by Hans Christian Andersen, which was 'The Little Mermaid,' and I don't know if you remember 'The Little Mermaid,' but it's dreadfully sad. The little mermaid falls in love with this prince, but she cannot marry him because she is a mermaid.|Alice Munro|Love, Reading, Me 
The history of soccer is a sad voyage from beauty to duty. When the sport became an industry, the beauty that blossoms from the joy of play got torn out by its very roots.|Eduardo Galeano|Beauty, History, Joy

When you're going through something, whether it's a wonderful thing like having a child or a sad thing like losing somebody, you often feel like 'Oh my God, I'm so overwhelmed; I'm dealing with this huge thing on my own.' In fact, poetry's a nice reminder that, no, everybody goes through it. These are universal experiences.|Caroline Kennedy|God, Poetry, Child 
We've got people looking at our seamy side and our sad side a lot of the time because that's easier. It's much more difficult to make a film about happiness with lots of jokes in it.|Emma Thompson|Happiness, Time, People

I've never really been met with indifference, where they say, 'Who cares?' I think that's what good art is supposed to do. It's not supposed to make you feel good about your own prejudices and your own values; it's supposed to open you up in some way and get you outraged or make you happy or make you sad or whatever it's going to do.|T. C. Boyle|Art, Happy, Good 
Dance has helped me overcome a lot of personal challenges. If I feel sad or depressed, I just go to the set and dance. It makes me feel alive.|Remo D'Souza|Dance, Challenges, Me 
I'm quite an odd little part of the Venn diagram. I'm not a movie star and beautiful in that way. I do an odd thing that's funny and sad, and my face and my old body can take that.|Tamsin Greig|Funny, Beautiful, Body 
I've traveled around the country and I read local newspapers and all of that, and it's a sad, sad thing to go from city to city and see the small newspapers and they're tiny. They're tiny not only in size but also in scope.|Jim Lehrer|City, Small, See

Every day, when I am working with my boys, I tell them as long as you put in your best efforts, I am there to back you. But the day I find your energy flagging on the field, the day I find you have not put in your best, that's when I will be really upset and sad.|Nita Ambani|Day, Best, I Am 
I'm a person who likes these sort of movies... sad but moving 'art movies' that normally are at a festival and then they go to a small art house theater and disappear.|Zach Braff|Art, Moving, Small 
Music videos are notoriously long, not fun, grueling.

Poetry is a beautiful way of expressing feelings - happy, sad, angry, caring. It's also a way that we share with other people, to help them with those feelings.|Mattie Stepanek|Happy, Beautiful, Caring

There is something sad about clothes laid in a tomb of trunks.|Suzy Menkes|Clothes, Something, Laid

You see guys going up to girls in bars and saying, 'Oh, can I show you a trick?' It's a tool. I find it kind of sad; it breaks my heart a little bit. They should try to use their own personalities. It sort of smacks of using magic as a crutch, which is not what it should be.|Keith Barry|Heart, Magic, Saying 
Making people laugh is so much more difficult than making them sad. Too much fiction defaults to the somber, the tragic. This is because sad endings are easy in comparison - happy endings aren't at all simple to earn, especially when writing to an audience jaded by them.|Stephen Graham Jones|Happy, Writing, Simple

As a songwriter I hate this whole, 'If it's a sad song, it has to sound like a sad song thing.' And that goes all the way back to my days with the Format. I'm an insane narcissist, so if I have to get something off my chest, I'll get something off my chest.|Nate Ruess|Hate, Song, Insane 
I take my inspiration for the song writing from little experiences, not even if I've experienced them myself but say if something has made me sad, I will use that emotion. I just use everyday life and write about it.|Pixie Lott|Life, Myself, Writing

The music of ABBA is not that happy. It might sound happy, in some strange way, but deep within, it's not happy music. It has that Nordic melancholic feeling to it.

We have real cliched ideas of what prison life is like. It is not a happy place. It's a desperate, sad situation.|Powers Boothe|Life, Happy, Ideas

I love sad. Sadness makes you feel more than anything.|Jeff Ament|Love, Sadness, You 
Ghost! I miss him! Is that weird? I miss him even though I invented him. I feel a lot of tenderness toward him. I don't write a lot of stuff that is sad or that is tender and affectionate, so that has a very special place in my heart.|Mallory Ortberg|Heart, Weird, Place

What is sad to me is not what Bill Nye thinks about me. What I found really unfortunate is that after presenting my stand on God's Word, there were a number of Christians who were more complimentary of Bill Nye than of me because Bill Nye was defending evolution and billions of years.|Ken Ham|God, Me, Evolution

I like to play the grey areas in life - that's the most uncomfortable place to be. Nobody likes to be in that in-between state where there don't know what's going to happen.

Women often don't want to be typecast as the girl that's sad.|Julia Michaels|Women, Girl, Want 
If you listen to the radio, it's all men who are emotional and women who are sexual. There's nothing wrong with that! It definitely should be the case, but it makes me sad that women are afraid to be emotional because it makes them look weak.|Julia Michaels|Women, Men, Me

I am not a sad clown. I am not a sad clown.|Nathan Lane|I Am, Clown, Am

I remember that I used to get lots of books from the library, and 'Little Women' was one of them.

You go from nobody looking at you to people taking second looks. I remember really loving it - and then feeling so guilty for loving it. Like, 'That's gross, Kristen.' Also, telling myself it could go away at any moment, and I'd be so sad.|Kristen Schaal|Myself, Moment, Remember

I belong in America more than South Africa. I can't remember the feeling of living there anymore. It's like it was in another life. That's sad in a way. It is my country. It's where I grew up.

It's sad when you can't make everyone happy, though. It's impossible but, at the same time, you still hope. You think, 'Maybe I can do it,' but you know you can't.

If you're sitting in coach and hoping for a drink, good luck.|Hope Davis|Good, Luck, Speak

Your joys and sorrows. You can never tell them. You cheapen the inside of yourself if you do tell them.|Greta Garbo|Yourself, You, Never

What hasn't evolved is mankind's spirituality; everything is from 3,000 years ago. With spirituality comes morals, a better way of thinking.|Damian Marley|Thinking, Evolution, Better 
Digital technology has several features that can make it much easier for teachers to pay special attention to all their students.|Bill Gates|Digital, Attention, Special

Many people who try to do big bold things in the world find out it's not about the money or the technology: It's about the regulatory hurdles that will try and stop you.|Peter Diamandis|Money, World, People 
SpaceX is only 12 years old now. Between now and 2040, the company's lifespan will have tripled. If we have linear improvement in technology, as opposed to logarithmic, then we should have a significant base on Mars, perhaps with thousands or tens of thousands of people.|Elon Musk|Improvement, People, Company 
Ever since the arrival of printing - thought to be the invention of the devil because it would put false opinions into people's minds - people have been arguing that new technology would have disastrous consequences for language.|David Crystal|Thought, Language, People 
Computers are still technology because we are still wrestling with it: it's still being invented we're still trying to work out how it works. There's a world of game interaction to come that you or I wouldn't recognise. It's time for the machines to disappear. The computer's got to disappear into all of the things we use.|Douglas Adams|Work, Time, World 
CRATEL is a center with a two-fold mission - to explore technology as an expressive element and to use technology to bridge gaps between diverse groups of people.|John Harrison|Bridge, People, Mission

Banking technology has made it simple and efficient to invest in good causes.|Mark Skousen|Good, Simple, Banking 
All of our technology is completely unnecessary to a happy life.|Tom Hodgkinson|Life, Happy, Happy Life 
I think technology is us, not something we invented. I think we are more psychic now because we have cell phones and you can look and see who's calling you. When people start seeing technology as us, as humanity, our whole idea of what existence is, is going to shift.|Ryan Trecartin|Humanity, Start, People 
We always say Jordan is not rich in natural resources - we don't have oil or gas like some of our neighbors do - but I think in terms of human resources, we are quite lucky and we are really trying to foster an environment of innovation and technology. I think Jordan will emerge as a center of innovation in the Middle East.|Queen Rania of Jordan|Innovation, Rich 
Technology has allowed me to reach my fans directly. Social media: it has been a complete revolution of how to interact, promote and share things.|Tony Hawk|Social Media, Media, Me 
I love the new technology. New things give you a reason to want to go to the studio. New challenges mean you have to keep up, you know?|Dr. Dre|Love, Challenges, New Things 
It's one of the fundamental principles of the stock market: When interest rates go up, stocks go down. And along with financial companies and cyclicals, technology companies - with their sky-high price-to-earnings multiples - should be among the biggest losers in an environment of rising rates.|Alex Berenson|Financial, Stock Market 
Of course, technology is not an exogenous force over which humans have no control. We are not constrained by a binary choice between acceptance and rejection. Rather, the decisions we make every day as citizens, consumers, and investors guide technological progress.|Klaus Schwab|Day, Progress, Decisions 
I will talk about two sets of things. One is how productivity and collaboration are reinventing the nature of work, and how this will be very important for the global economy. And two, data. In other words, the profound impact of digital technology that stems from data and the data feedback loop.|Satya Nadella|Work, Nature, Collaboration

Television is a medium because anything well done is rare.|Fred Allen|Well Done, Television, Done 
There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented, and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.|Mark Zuckerberg|Future, Opportunity, Focus 
Communism is a monopolistic system, economically and politically. The system suppresses individual initiative, and the 21st century is all about individualism and freedom. The development of technology supported these directions.|Lech Walesa|Freedom, Development 
'Social engineering,' the fancy term for tricking you into giving away your digital secrets, is at least as great a threat as spooky technology.|Barton Gellman|Great, Giving, Engineering

From coast to coast, the FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission have ensnared people not only at hedge funds, but at technology and pharmaceutical companies, consulting and law firms, government agencies, and even a major stock exchange.|Preet Bharara|Law, Government, People 
The only protection as a historian is to institute a process of research and writing that minimizes the possibility of error.

With a fourth generation of nuclear power, you can have a technology that will burn more than 99 percent of the energy in the fuel. It would mean that you don't need to mine uranium for the next thousand years.|James Hansen|Power, Generation, Energy 
I think there's a gigantic generation gap in terms of how people understand the Internet and how much they think technology is an important factor in social change.|Alex Steffen|Change, Internet, People 
'The Victorian Internet' is a must read for anyone interested in the history of technology and in the cycles of hype, boom, and bust that seem to only quicken with each new wave of innovation. Highly recommended.|John Battelle|History, Innovation 
Robots are interesting because they exist as a real technology that you can really study - you can get a degree in robotics - and they also have all this pop-culture real estate that they take up in people's minds.|Daniel H. Wilson|Real Estate, People, Robots 
The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.|Tim Berners-Lee|Future, Past, Bigger 
Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts.|William Gibson|Children, Daily, Nation 
I think complexity is mostly sort of crummy stuff that is there because it's too expensive to change the interface.|Jaron Lanier|Change, Think, Complexity 
I used to think that cyberspace was fifty years away. What I thought was fifty years away, was only ten years away. And what I thought was ten years away... it was already here. I just wasn't aware of it yet.|Bruce Sterling|Thought, Think, Fifty 
The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite.|Thomas Sowell|Science, People 
It's hard to pay attention these days because of multiple affects of the information technology nowadays. You tend to develop a faster, speedier mind, but I don't think it's necessarily broader or smarter.|Robert Redford|Mind, Information, Think 
Refuse to accept the belief that your professional relevance, career success or financial security turns on the next update on the latest technology. Sometimes it's good to put the paddle down and just let the canoe glide.|Simon Mainwaring|Success, Good, Financial 
There's still something so pure and heartfelt and emotional and genuine about a bouquet of flowers that, even with all the advances of technology and the millions of ways we have to communicate with each other, flowers are still relevant in my opinion.|Vanessa Diffenbaugh|Flowers, Opinion, Emotional 
If Wikileaks didn't resolve that question for folks - at the end of the day, there are no secrets. We're living in a glass neighborhood, in a fishbowl, and technology, white hat hackers, the folks that are doing the right thing with hacking.|Gavin Newsom|Day, End 
If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don't understand the problems and you don't understand the technology.|Bruce Schneier|Problems, Security, Think

As information technology restructures the work situation, it abstracts thought from action.|Shoshana Zuboff|Work, Thought, Action 
I wanted to be a pilot. I loved flying and I loved all the technology and the equipment and the sense of adventure that came with it. I think that feeling still bleeds over into everything I do today.|Graham Brown|Adventure, Today, Flying 
Every technology, including the printing press, comes at some price.|Bill Keller|Price, Printing, Press 
I don't think any of us can do much about the rapid growth of new technology. A new technology helps to fuel the economy, and any discussion of slowing its growth has to take account of economic consequences. However, it is possible for us to learn how to control our own uses of technology.|Neil Postman|Growth, Control, Think 
The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates.|Gabe Newell|Work, Service, Giving 
If information wants to be free, then that's true everywhere, not just in information technology.|Mitch Kapor|Information, Free

When we're talking about technology that involves weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, there has to be an element of preemption.|John Sununu|Chemical, Talking 
Today, the technology is there to give early and normally ample warning when a powerful tornado approaches. When a tornado strikes, all of us are at risk.|Spencer Bachus|Today, Powerful, Risk 
Part of the problem is when we bring in a new technology we expect it to be perfect in a way that we don't expect the world that we're familiar with to be perfect.|Esther Dyson|World, Problem, Perfect 
The underlying principles of strategy are enduring, regardless of technology or the pace of change.|Michael Porter|Change, Strategy, Principles

We were promised a simpler life, and technology has only complicated our lives.|Freeman Thomas|Life, Complicated, Our Lives 
Technology makes things faster and more cost-effective, but it's not perfect. It requires you to be as flexible as you can be.|John Phillips|Not Perfect, Perfect, You 
I love technology. We can be our own DJs wherever we go.|Ludacris|Love, Go, Wherever 
If you wanna know how not secure you are, just take a look around. Nothing's secure. Nothing's safe. I don't hate technology, I don't hate hackers, because that's just what comes with it, without those hackers we wouldn't solve the problems we need to solve, especially security.|Fred Durst|Hate, Problems, Know 
Who knows what technology will emerge in the next five years, let alone 20. Yet the education we provide our children now is supposed to last for decades. We cannot train them for jobs that do not even exist yet, but we can provide them with the minds and tools they'll need to adapt to our ever-changing set of circumstances.|Jim Hunt|Education, Children, Alone 
You can be good at technology and like fashion and art. You can be good at technology and be a jock. You can be good at technology and be a mom. You can do it your way, on your terms.|Marissa Mayer|Art, Good, Mom 
A company can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on firewalls, intrusion detection systems and encryption and other security technologies, but if an attacker can call one trusted person within the company, and that person complies, and if the attacker gets in, then all that money spent on technology is essentially wasted.|Kevin Mitnick|Money, Security, Company 
I know nothing about technology.|Jack Ma|Know, Nothing, About 
Sampling is kind of prehistoric, given the technology and the textures you can create.|Macklemore|You, Kind, Create 
The moment of drifting into thought has been so clipped by modern technology. Our lives are filled with distraction with smartphones and all the rest. People are so locked into not being present.|Glen Hansard|Thought, Moment, People 
Advancements in technology have become so commonplace that sometimes we forget to stop and think about how incredible it is that a girl on her laptop in Texas can see photos and cell phone video in real time that a young college student has posted of a rally he's at in Iran.|Rosalind Wiseman|Time, College, Girl 
Disco is the first technology music. And what I mean is that 'disco' music is named after discs, because when technology grew to where they didn't need a band in the clubs, the DJ played it on a disc.|will.i.am|Music, DJ, Mean 
A revolution is to bring on change and we're spiritual people trying to bring on spiritual change. It might sound like I'm a dreamer, but economic models have reached their height of evolution. Technology has evolved. What hasn't evolved is mankind's spirituality; everything is from 3,000 years ago.|Damian Marley|Change, Spiritual, People 
The joke about SAP has always been, it's making '50s German manufacturing methodology, implemented in 1960s software technology, delivered to 1970-style manufacturing organizations, like, it's really - yeah, the incumbency - they are still the lingering hangover from the dot-com crash.|Marc Andreessen|Software, Manufacturing 
Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology, like the steam engine before it. General purpose technologies drive most economic growth, because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations, like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.|Erik Brynjolfsson|Growth, Purpose, Electricity 
The biggest challenge is that when people look at low price point products, they essentially invest less money in development, innovation, and new technology. And in order to innovate at a lower price point, and make sustainability attainable to the masses, you have to invest more. But that's counterintuitive for a lot of businesses.|Yves Behar|Money, Innovation, Challenge 
We're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology, wireless and mobile now - an era of digital medicine. Even my stethoscope is now digital. And of course, there's an app for that.|Daniel Kraft|Moving, Information 
The rate of technological and human physiological change in the 20th century has been remarkable. Beyond that, a synergy between the improved technology and physiology is more than the simple addition of the two.|Robert Fogel|Change, Simple 
Digital technology allows us a much larger scope to tell stories that were pretty much the grounds of the literary media.|George Lucas|Media, Digital, Pretty 
My filmmaking really began with technology. It began through technology, not through telling stories, because my 8mm movie camera was the way into whatever I decided to do.|Steven Spielberg|Filmmaking, Camera, Way 
There was a time in the 1930s when magazine writers could actually make a good living. 'The Saturday Evening Post' and 'Collier's' both had three stories in each issue. These were usually entertaining, and people really went for them. But then television came along, and now of course, information technology... the new way of killing time.|Tom Wolfe|Time, Good, Television 
Whenever a new technology is introduced into society, there must be a counterbalancing human response - that is, high touch - or the technology is rejected... We must learn to balance the material wonders of technology with the spiritual demands of our human nature.|John Naisbitt|Nature, Spiritual, Society 
There's an ongoing competition by global companies across all areas from products, technology development and hiring talented people to patent disputes. The market is big and opportunities are wide open, so we should find out new businesses that Samsung's future will hinge on.|Lee Kun-hee|Future, Competition 
We are gods. Our tools make us gods. In symbiosis with our technology, our powers are expanding exponentially and so, too, our possibilities.|Jason Silva|Tools, Possibilities, Us 
Technology is the means by which we have decommissioned natural selection and are seizing control. We are no longer to be victims of some blind evolutionary process where sentient beings are massacred by entropy.|Jason Silva|Blind, Control, Process 
Why should Congresspeople have to visit D.C.? Thanks to Skype, meetings are possible across the country. Thanks to email, communications are simple. And we've had the technology to vote from afar for decades. Why should we have backroom deals made over cigars thousands of miles distant from those who are affected by those deals?|Ben Shapiro|Simple, Meetings, Why 
It's a great time for independent media because technology reduces the entry barrier. It makes it a phenomenal time for media in general. It's David versus Goliath, and David is always a little smarter, more nimble, more fast.|Sasa Vucinic|Time, Great, Media 
When Tim Berners-Lee invented the computer code that led to the creation of the World Wide Web in 1990, he did not try to patent or charge fees for the use of his technology.|Rebecca MacKinnon|World, Creation, Try 
Museums provide places of relaxation and inspiration. And most importantly, they are a place of authenticity. We live in a world of reproductions - the objects in museums are real. It's a way to get away from the overload of digital technology.|Thomas P. Campbell|World, Live, Digital 
One of the things you learn operating in the technology industry is disruptions are occurring every day.|Dick Costolo|Day, Every Day, You 
The PC is successful because we're all benefiting from the competition with each other. If Twitter comes along, our games benefit. If Nvidia makes better graphics technology, all the games are going to shine. If we come out with a better game, people are going to buy more PCs.|Gabe Newell|Competition, Successful 
The NFL is a unique work place. There are no secrets anymore. Technology has taken over, and secrets are exposed. People are going to know what you're all about. You have to make sure you have real honesty in the work place, or you're going to be exposed.|Andy Reid|Work, Honesty, Unique 
Environmentalists should like fracking for its relative cleanliness. But they don't. They have made a bugaboo out of the chemicals in fracking fluids, which supposedly can leach into groundwater sources. I'm convinced they're dead wrong. Ultimately, good technology with a cost advantage will win out over paranoia.|Kenneth Fisher|Good, Win, Cleanliness 
Every time there's a new tool, whether it's Internet or cell phones or anything else, all these things can be used for good or evil. Technology is neutral; it depends on how it's used.|Rick Smolan|Time, Good, Evil 
Spiraling demand for resources of which our world contains a finite supply is the great long-term threat posed by globalisation. That is why we need new technology to relieve it.|Peter Thiel|Great, World, Why 
A country's economic growth may be defined as a long-term rise in capacity to supply increasingly diverse economic goods to its population, this growing capacity based on advancing technology and the institutional and ideological adjustments that it demands.|Simon Kuznets|Growth, Rise, Country 
As technology advances, so too does terrorists' use of technology to communicate - both to inspire and recruit. The widespread use of technology propagates the persistent terrorist message to attack U.S. interests, whether in the homeland or abroad.|James Comey|Inspire, Message 
We often hear people talk about the concept of 'uberization,' where a new technology completely turns an industry on its head and forces us to rethink the way things have always been done. No industry will remain untouched by these forces.|Klaus Schwab|People, Done, New 
There's already a lot of active research going on using the Crispr technology to fix diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. They're all diseases that have known genetic causes, and we now have the technology that can repair those mutations to provide, we hope, patients with a normal life.|Jennifer Doudna|Life, Hope, Research 
Every film that comes out that incorporates CGI or performance capture is a little bit ahead of the last film that came out. You're on the cutting edge for a certain amount of time, and then the new technology comes out.|Ben Schnetzer|Time, Performance, You 
Our philosophy is that we want to be an ecosystem. Our philosophy is to empower others to sell, empower others to service, making sure the other people are more powerful than us. With our technology, our innovation, our partners - 10 million small business sellers - they can compete with Microsoft and IBM.|Jack Ma|Business, Innovation 
To understand the future of technology, we need to begin with one fundamental truth: Technology is natural.|Gray Scott|Future, Truth, Natural 
Technology will mirror the culture and the psychology creating it. We need new psychological scaffolding to work with. Less fear and more optimism.|Gray Scott|Work, Fear, Culture 
Technology does not always rhyme with perfection and reliability. Far from it in reality!|Jean-Michel Jarre|Perfection, Reality, Rhyme 
When you think about it, media's the intersection of content and technology - it's all about storytelling, like photography and the camera.|Bob Iger|Media, Photography, Think 
It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years.|John von Neumann|Limits, Silly, Achieve 
If your goal is anything but profitability - if it's to be big, or to grow fast, or to become a technology leader - you'll hit problems.|Michael Porter|Leader, Goal, Problems 
Technology isn't the enemy, it is our ally, but only if we adopt a new model that puts people before profit. I realize that we seem far from that model, but I have seen it in action and it is a beautiful thing. So I'm not willing to give up yet. Hope is the last thing to die.|Justin Sane|Hope, Beautiful, Action 
You used to have to sing and convey emotion, and now, well, technically you can do anything with technology. It sucks for music today, but that's why that old music feels so good to me.|Christina Aguilera|Music, Good, Today 
I got so passionate about technology. Hacking to me was like a video game. It was about getting trophies. I just kept going on and on, despite all the trouble I was getting into, because I was hooked.|Kevin Mitnick|Game, Me, Passionate 
When people come to Twitter and they want to express something in the world, the technology fades away. It's them writing a simple message and them knowing that people are going to see it.|Jack Dorsey|Writing, Simple, World 
No matter how much technology changes scouting, no matter how much free agency and big TV contracts change the business of baseball, I hope and pray that the heart of the game will never change.|Pat Gillick|Change, Business, Hope 
We can't stop a baby in Africa from starving to death... but we can afford enough technology and weaponry to blow the world up a million times over.|Paul Weller|Death, Baby, World 
There are still some natural forces that everybody understands. Technology and industry have distanced people from nature and magic and human values.|Laura Esquivel|Nature, Values, People 
Technology is incredibly powerful. And in many ways, the sky is the limit in terms of what you can actually accomplish with the right science and the right technology. But to get there, you have to actually invest in R&D. And often that means you have to be willing to spend an awful lot in that R&D phase before you see the benefits.|Ramez Naam|Science, Sky, Powerful 
Technology itself is neither good nor bad. People are good or bad.|Naveen Jain|Good, People, Bad People 
Despite the Obama administration's proclaimed commitment to global Internet freedom, the executive branch is not transparent about the types and capabilities of surveillance technologies it is sourcing and purchasing - or about what other governments are purchasing the same technology.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Freedom, Commitment 
The space elevator's not just another competitive technology, promoted by people who simply like the idea of diminishing the luster of the thrusters. It would open wide the doors to space.|Seth Shostak|Space, People, Doors 
The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.|Antoine de Saint-Exupery|Nature, Great, Man 
I am a geek dad, believe me. I've got my iPad with me; I've got my iPhone 4; I've got my Xbox. I love technology and I want to feel like I'm living in the future, and these devices help me feel that way.|Dee Bradley Baker|Love, Future, I Am 
The technology at the leading edge changes so rapidly that you have to keep current after you get out of school. I think probably the most important thing is having good fundamentals.|Gordon Moore|Good, School, Changes 
The first footfalls on Mars will mark a historic milestone, an enterprise that requires human tenacity matched with technology to anchor ourselves on another world.|Buzz Aldrin|World, Mars, Human 
It's so funny: whenever there's a new technology introduced, there's always this fear it's going to end entertainment as we know it. When records came around, they were going to be the end of live music. Nobody would ever want to go see live music again.|Elvis Mitchell|Funny, Music, Fear 
I can't say I'm particularly happy about all the spam and the viruses and the equivalent that we see on the Net, but I think technology can deal with many of the problems that we're now seeing, whether it's filtering or whatever, and laws may help a lot.|Vint Cerf|Happy, Problems, Help 
Yet now we are faced with the sickening suspicion that technology has run ahead of us.|Richard Dooling|Run, Now, Ahead 
Technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe.|Alan Watts|Universe, People, Hands 
We humans have a love-hate relationship with our technology. We love each new advance and we hate how fast our world is changing... The robots really embody that love-hate relationship we have with technology.|Daniel H. Wilson|Love, Relationship, Hate 
People are so busy positioning themselves before the screen and talking on the damn cellphones, communicating, that we're not reading, and in fact we're not really communicating, either. We're not talking to each other. There's just all these screens and wires and technology in between.|Lee Smith|Reading, Busy, People 
The Web and new technology offer more opportunities to reach a world market at a lower price. Today, a person can start a business at home and reach the world market.|Robert Kiyosaki|Business, Home, Today 
I don't know technology and engineering. I don't know accounting.|Bernard Ebbers|Accounting, Engineering

While the rest of the world has been improving technology, Ghana has been improving the quality of man's humanity to man.|Maya Angelou|Man, Humanity, World 
Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them.|Alfred North Whitehead|Thinking, Important 
It is only when they go wrong that machines remind you how powerful they are.|Clive James|Powerful, You, Go 
We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren't that many things people use twice a day.|Larry Page|Day, Beautiful, People 
Technology sometimes gets a bad rap because of certain consequences that it's had on the environment and unforeseen problems, but we shouldn't use it as an excuse to reject our tools; rather, we should decide that we need to make better tools to solve the problems caused by the initial tools in a progressive wave of innovation.|Jason Silva|Innovation, Problems, Tools 
There are many museums dedicated to technology, artistic endeavors, music, and that sort of thing. From that perspective, I think games really do have a place as a kind of collaborative art or a synthesis of all these various aspects into a whole, and that, in itself, can be perceived as art.|Hideo Kojima|Music, Art, Perspective 
I don't care about the internal political system of the United States. I want to be a friend of United States, of its baseball, its institutions, its rock and roll, its workers, and its technology because we need it. I want to be friends of the Arab people, of the Persian people, of the Asian people.|Hugo Chavez|Friends, Baseball 
Technology is making gestures precise and brutal, and with them men.|Theodor Adorno|Men, Gestures, Brutal 
It's impossible to move, to live, to operate at any level without leaving traces, bits, seemingly meaningless fragments of personal information.|William Gibson|Impossible, Leaving

I really believe that we don't have to make a trade-off between security and privacy. I think technology gives us the ability to have both.|John Poindexter|Believe, Security, Think 
If you think about brewing, it is biotechnology. And I would say that I was a technologist at heart. So whether I... fermented beer or whether I fermented enzymes, the base technology was the same.|Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw|Heart, Beer, Think 
I just invent, then wait until man comes around to needing what I've invented.|R. Buckminster Fuller|Man, Wait, Just

It's hard to say exactly what it is about face-to-face contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet been duplicated by technology.|Paul Graham|Happen, Whatever, Say 
An awful lot of successful technology companies ended up being in a slightly different market than they started out in. Microsoft started with programming tools, but came out with an operating system. Oracle started doing contracts for the CIA. AOL started out as an online video gaming network.|Marc Andreessen|Successful, Tools, Doing 
Technology is notorious for engrossing people so much that they don't always focus on balance and enjoy life at the same time.|Paul Allen|Life, Time, Focus 
Technology challenges us to assert our human values, which means that first of all, we have to figure out what they are.|Sherry Turkle|Challenges, Values, Human 
There are moments of opportunity for families moments they need to put technology away. These include: no phones or texting during meals. No phones or texting when parents pick up children at school - a child is looking to make eye contact with a parent!|Sherry Turkle|Children, School, Parents 
I was nerdy girl who went to Catholic school and wanted to be an engineer. I was all set to attend the Illinois Institute of Technology. And then I took a hard left turn and studied Liberal Arts at Northern Illinois University, majored in Communications. Then worked in radio as a disk jockey and as the weather girl.|Cindy Morgan|School, Girl, Weather 
I always get sick of these conversations where people are so obsessed with pixels, with high definition, and even with technology in general. I find it just dull and heartless. And so I wanted to use only the worst machines.|Harmony Korine|People, Sick, Find 
The perfect example of Darwinism is what technology has done to businesses.|Charlie Munger|Perfect, Done, Example

Technology, outsourcing, a growing temp staffing industry, productivity efficiencies, have all replaced the middle class.|James Altucher|Productivity, Class, Growing 
Soon silence will have passed into legend. Man has turned his back on silence. Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation.|Jean Arp|Life, Day, Humanity 
No one bill will cure the problem of spam. It will take a combined effort of legislation, litigation, enforcement, customer education, and technology solutions.|David Baker|Education, Effort, Problem 
I am a great enthusiast and early adopter of technology, but sometimes I wonder whether the inexorable integration of technology in our lives could diminish some of our quintessential human capacities, such as compassion and cooperation.|Klaus Schwab|Great, Compassion, I Am 
Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.|Linus Torvalds|Evil, Just, Microsoft 
The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology.|Marshall McLuhan|Consequences, New, Personal 
Despite all our gains in technology, product innovation and world markets, most people are not thriving in the organizations they work for.|Stephen Covey|Work, Innovation, World

Every aspect of human technology has a dark side, including the bow and arrow.|Margaret Atwood|Dark, Dark Side, Human 
If technology and communications can adapt to people's modern lifestyles, then why can't our labor laws follow suit? Private-sector businesses continue to live under an outdated federal mandate that says the only way to compensate for overtime is through cash wages.|Renee Ellmers|People, Live, Why 
When e-commerce companies build scale, cost comes down. Companies that can handle scale and reduce costs over time will win. Margins will come from reducing costs over time and not by increasing prices. Technology is the answer at large scale.|Sachin Bansal|Time, Win, Down 
Skin has become inadequate in interfacing with reality. Technology has become the body's new membrane of existence.|Nam June Paik|Reality, Body, Existence 
I want to do very useful buildings and I would like to find a method of producing these buildings through our technology because I think that this is the only way that we will gain wonderful environment easily in the future.|Minoru Yamasaki|Future, Environment, Want

Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money?|James Heywood|Money, Good, Great 
I'm always working on new songs. With the technology these days, any idiot can record on Pro Tools on your laptop. All you have to do is plug a microphone into the input jack and anybody can have their own recording studio. So I'm always down in my basement, singing along to riffs or whoever I'm collaborating with.|Sebastian Bach|Singing, Tools, You 
Because we imagine, we can have invention and technology. It's actually play, not necessity, that is the mother of invention.|Alison Gopnik|Mother, Play, Imagine 
With any advent in technology, any technological innovation, there is the good and the bad.|Henry Rollins|Good, Innovation 
As technology continues to increase our possibilities, what we're seeing is a shrinking of the lag time between what we dream about and what we create.|Jason Silva|Time, Dream, Seeing 
Technology investment drove growth in the 1990s, both directly and by fueling a rising stock market that led to increased consumer spending.|Alex Berenson|Growth, Stock Market

I'm constantly questioning the effects technology has had on our lives and the effect that monetary debt has had on all of us. We keep this as a dark little secret: 'This is how much interest I owe.'|Rami Malek|Dark, Debt, Secret 
I think that technology is the best thing that ever happened to mankind. It's an absurd notion that somehow, 'My God, what are we going to do when driverless cars come along?' It's going to save lives on the road. And maybe, one day, we'll all be working four days a week and not five or six days a week.|Jamie Dimon|Day, Best, God 
AI might be a powerful technology, but things won't get better simply by adding AI.|Vivienne Ming|Powerful, Better, Things 
Technology has a shadow side. It accounts for real progress in medicine, but has also hurt it in many ways, making it more impersonal, expensive and dangerous. The false belief that a safety net of sophisticated drugs and machines stretches below us, permitting risky or lazy lifestyle choices, has undermined our spirit of self-reliance.|Andrew Weil|Progress, Safety, Shadow 
Technology no longer consists just of hardware or software or even services, but of communities. Increasingly, community is a part of technology, a driver of technology, and an emergent effect of technology.|Howard Rheingold|Community, Software, Just 
We had to address information technology in the ways we had not before and give the agents the tools that they need to do their job more efficiently and more expeditiously.|Robert Mueller|Job, Information, Tools 
Readers probably haven't heard much about it yet, but they will. Quantum technology turns ordinary reality upside down.|Michael Crichton|Reality, Down, Upside Down 
Technology has given us this wonderful opportunity to have low energy costs. We have to seize that, rather than keep debating and discussing and fighting over it.|Michael Porter|Opportunity, Energy

Certainly the advent of technology and electronic commerce has had an immense impact on the real estate industry.|Michael Oxley|Real Estate, Impact, Real 
Computer games tend to be boys' games, warlike games with more violence. We have not spent enough time thinking through how to encourage more girls to be involved in computing before coming to college so they can see a possible career in information technology.|Freeman A. Hrabowski III|Time, College, Violence 
We need a wireless mobile device ecosystem that mirrors the PC/Internet ecosystem, one where the consumers' purchase of network capacity is separate from their purchase of the hardware and software they use on that network. It will take government action, or some disruptive technology or business innovation, to get us there.|Walt Mossberg|Business, Innovation 
We are not overpopulated in an absolute sense; we've got the technology for 10 billion, probably 15 billion people, to live on this planet and live good lives. What we haven't done is developed our technology.|David Attenborough|Good, People, Live

What new technology does is create new opportunities to do a job that customers want done.|Tim O'Reilly|Job, Opportunities, Want 
The great thing that guys like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and the Google guys have in common is they treat their technology like it's art, and I suppose in the hands of virtuosos like them, it is.|Harvey Weinstein|Art, Great, Treat 
In the smart home of the future, there should be a robot designed to talk to you. With enough display technology, connectivity, and voice recognition, this human-interface robot or head-of-household robot will serve as a portal to the digital domain. It becomes your interface to your robot-enabled home.|Colin Angle|Future, Home, Smart 
Technology may create a condition, but the questions are what do we do about ourselves. We better understand ourselves pretty clearly and we better find ways to like ourselves.|Herbert Simon|Questions, Better, Find 
We must speed up the deployment of broadband in order to bring high-speed data services to homes and businesses. The spread of information technology has contributed to a steady growth in U.S. productivity.|Michael Oxley|Growth, Information, Data 
Digital imaging has untied our hands with regards to technical limitations. We no longer have to be arbiters of technology we get to participate in the interpretation of technology into creative content. |John Dykstra|Creative, Digital, Hands 
I honestly believe that the next big leap in immersive technology will be very much like Brainstorm.|Douglas Trumbull|Believe, Leap, Will 
People always underestimate the impact of technology. To give you an example: In the 1970s the frontier for offshore development was 200 meters, today it is 4,000 meters.|Daniel Yergin|Today, Impact, People

The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the art.|John Lasseter|Art, Challenges, Inspires 
As part of our layered approach, we have expedited the deployment of new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) units to help detect concealed metallic and non-metallic threats on passengers. These machines are now in use at airports nationwide, and the vast majority of travelers say they prefer this technology to alternative screening measures.|Janet Napolitano|Help, New, Say 
All images generated by imaging technology are viewed in a walled-off location not visible to the public. The officer assisting the passenger never sees the image, and the officer viewing the image never interacts with the passenger. The imaging technology that we use cannot store, export, print or transmit images.|Janet Napolitano|Never, Location, Print 
Advances in the technology of telecommunications have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere.|Rupert Murdoch|Threat, Telecommunications 
I love what the Valley does. I love company building. I love startups. I love technology companies. I love new technology. I love this process of invention.

I love the modern technology now.|Ringo Starr|Love, Modern Technology 
I managed Hewlett Packard through the worst technology downturn in 25 years, the dotcom bust.|Carly Fiorina|Worst, Years, Through 
Technology will definitely solve all our problems, but in the process it will create brand new ones. But that's O.K. because the most you can expect from life is to get to solve better and better problems.|Scott Adams|Life, Problems, Brand 
The world dominion of western thought, forms of organisation, technology and military force is not God-given, nor eternal, nor greatly appreciated by the rest of the world.|James Buchan|Thought, World, Military 
With the world's human population now at seven billion and growing, and the demand for technology and modern conveniences increasing, we can't control all our negative impacts. But we have to find better ways to live within the limits nature and its cycles impose.|David Suzuki|Nature, World, Negative 
Technologists provide tools that can improve people's lives. But I want to be clear that I don't think technology by itself improves people's lives, since often I'm criticized for being too pro-technology. Unless there's commensurate ethical and moral improvements to go along with it, it's for naught.|Jaron Lanier|People, Tools, Moral 
And so when I moved to IBM, I moved because I thought I could apply technology. I didn't actually have to do my engineer - I was an electrical engineer, but I could apply it. And that was when I changed. And when I got there, though, I have to say, at the time, I really never felt there was a constraint about being a woman. I really did not.|Ginni Rometty|Time, Woman, Thought 
Not since the digital revolution in the early '90s has technology placed such a comprehensive burden on business, employees and individuals to reinvent their business plans, services and products, and themselves to keep pace with the changing marketplace.|Simon Mainwaring|Business, Employees, Digital 
It is the child's understanding that teaches the adults the way of the future. They're still doing it today with modern technology.|Michael Morpurgo|Future, Today, Child 
I think 99 percent of women's lib comes from technology making different kinds of lives possible, and then the social adjustment follows the technology - it doesn't precede it.|Lois McMaster Bujold|Women, Think, Social 
I have a grandson who is 20. He's a computer guy. I'm worried that he can't communicate without his machine. They have no personal contact with people. That's the bad part of technology.|Penny Marshall|People, Bad, Personal 
So I think the winners in recession are the people who produce new technology that does things better, which people really want.|James Dyson|People, Want, Think 
There was a study done in the early 20th century of all the entrepreneurs who entered the automobile industry around the same time as Henry Ford; there were something like 500 automotive companies that got funded, had the internal combustion engine, had the technology, and had the vision. Sixty percent of them folded within a couple of years.|Eric Ries|Time, Vision, Study 
All of the people who are using their BlackBerries or their iPhones, Facebook, all of the people who are sitting in cafes and hotels rooms doing their work, they're all using wireless technology, and we shouldn't assume that the only way of the future is high speed cable.|Tony Abbott|Work, Future, People 
All the big revolutions, whether it's the Industrial Revolution, the Arab Spring, those changes happened by economic and social shifts brought about by the people's voices, and those things weren't voted for. Most of our changes today are brought about through technology, not by voting.|Lupe Fiasco|Today, Changes, Spring 
We have to wonder whether digital technology, rather than making it easier to communicate, is actually doing the opposite. We now sit alone at a keyboard, firing off zeros and ones into the ether. Offices are silent.|Tom Hodgkinson|Alone, Silent, Digital 
I feel there is so much more we can do in improving education, making it accessible and understanding how technology can be a part of the solution.|Jim Breyer|Education, Understanding 
The biggest challenge for cyborgs is to be socially accepted. Society needs to accept that there are people who wish to use technology as part of the body.|Neil Harbisson|Challenge, Society, People 
Our technologised society is becoming opaque. As technology becomes more ubiquitous and our relationship with digital devices ever more seamless, our technical infrastructure seems to be increasingly intangible.|Honor Harger|Relationship, Society 
I wouldn't say you have an online life and a real life. I think technology is just mapping and organizing what already exists.|Ashton Kutcher|Life, Think, You 
I was convinced that eventually I would die of heart disease, that we'd run out of time and out of treatment, the technology wouldn't keep ahead of my disease. And now all of the sudden, when you get the new heart, your life opens up before you again.|Dick Cheney|Life, Time, Heart 
I knew that, when writing a book, you're not constrained by a budget. You're not constrained by what you can do, in terms of the special effects technology. You're not limited to any particular running time.|George R. R. Martin|Time, Writing, Book 
My only worry about tweeting and modern technology is how it has crept into even the darkest corners of the absolute global village we live in.|Denis Leary|Worry, Live, Darkest 
I think the Internet and technology in general has changed everything. We can see it overseas even more with the Arab Spring and so forth.|Jane Fonda|Internet, Spring, Think 
Disabled people need more invested in their education, housing, job training, transportation, assistive technology, and independent-living facilities. Governments earn back this investment - and more - by making people with disabilities economically productive citizens.|Jesse Ventura|Education, Job, Training 
Every young person gets so excited about new software packages and new technology.|John Lasseter|Software, Young, New 
Of course, mankind would not have landed on the Moon in 1969, were it not for two things: conquered Nazi rocket technology and post-war anti-Communist paranoia in the United States.|Charles Duke|Moon, Rocket, Paranoia 
I love technology. Matches, to light a fire, is really high tech. The wheel is really one of the great inventions of all time. Other than that, I am an ignoramus about technology.|William Shatner|Love, Time, Light 
Modern technology has taken the angst out of achieving the perfect shot. For me, the only thing that counts is the idea behind the image: what you want to see and what you're trying to say. The idea is crucial. You have to think of something you want to say and expand upon it.|Martin Parr|Achieving, Me, Want 
About every year or two, there is a moment of truth where there's some new development in the marketplace, some new technology, some sort of existential crisis. You just have to be vigilant about looking out for those moments.|Jeremy Stoppelman|Truth, Moment, Moments 
Software substitution, whether it's for drivers or waiters or nurses - it's progressing. Technology over time will reduce demand for jobs, particularly at the lower end of skill set.|Bill Gates|Time, End, Skill 
Our first challenge is to ensure safety of pilgrims, and we will use modern technology for that. We will strengthen our telecom network and will provide special mobile apps to the pilgrims at the time of registration.|Harish Rawat|Time, Challenge, Safety 
I'm trying my best to keep up with all this new technology, and I surround myself with all these wonderful people that are in the know and kind of help me out with all that.|Dolly Parton|Best, Myself, Help 
China is a great manufacturing center, but it's actually mostly an assembly plant. So it assembles parts and components, high technology that comes from the surrounding industrial - more advanced industrial centers - Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, the United States, Europe - and it basically assembles them.|Noam Chomsky|Great, Plant, Manufacturing 
Just as computer technology and the Internet created whole new industries and extraordinary benefits for people that extend into almost every realm of human endeavor from education to transportation to medicine, genetics will undoubtedly benefit people everywhere in ways we can't even imagine but know will surely occur.|Anne Wojcicki|Education, Internet, People 
You just have to adapt, and you have to realize where people are going to actually play their games. It used to just be Nintendo and PlayStation, and now it's all kind of devices. So you've got to learn to adapt what you know from the technology into those areas... I've been wanting to do a mobile game for a long time.|Tony Hawk|Time, Game, People 
Grassroots techies - the mostly unknown people who write code and start companies that don't make the headlines - hate, loathe, and despise Microsoft. At technology conferences, it is the devil, or the guaranteed laugh line. Its products are mocked, its business practices booed.|Virginia Postrel|Business, Hate, Laugh 
We have already discovered how quickly we become dependent on the Internet and its applications for business, government and research, so it is not surprising that we are finding that we can apply this technology to enable or facilitate our social interactions as well.|Vint Cerf|Business, Government 
It is time to stop debating whether the Internet is an effective tool for political expression and instead to address the much more urgent question of how digital technology can be structured, governed, and used to maximize the good and minimize the evil.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Time, Good, Evil 
My father taught us that to thrive, excellence in technology, quality, and customer service along with cost competitiveness is a prerequisite. His contribution to business, the economy, and society at large can never be underscored enough.|Kumar Mangalam Birla|Business, Father, Service 
Even technology companies get good news sometimes.|Alex Berenson|Good, News, Good News 
I think that for all of the dangers of technology spreading, I think it is more dangerous in some ways that it doesn't. My simple reason for that is we've got 7 billion people on the planet, and we have these very serious problems, and I think we don't know who's going to have the answers to the problems that are coming around the bend.|Daniel Suarez|Simple, Problems, People 
Our children will outwit us if they want; for when it comes to technology, they hold the higher ground. Unlike other tools passed carefully and ceremonially from one generation to the next - the sharp scissors, the car keys - this is one they understand better than we do.|Nancy Gibbs|Children, Car, Tools 
I think we're heading towards a world of what I call 'technological socialism.' Where technology - not the government or the state - will begin to take care of us. Technology will provide our healthcare for free. The best education in the world - for free.|Peter Diamandis|Education, Best, Government 
Innovation and disruption are the hallmarks of the technology world, and hardly a moment passes when we are not thinking, doing, or talking about these topics.|Steven Sinofsky|Innovation, Thinking, World 
When someone takes their existing business and tries to transform it into something else - they fail. In technology that is often the case. Look at Kodak: it was the dominant imaging company in the world. They did fabulously during the great depression, but then wiped out the shareholders because of technological change.|Charlie Munger|Change, Business, Great 
Once upon a time, sound was new technology.|Peter Jackson|Time, New, Sound 
It's a mistake to believe technology rests outside India. We compete very successfully.|Adi Godrej|Believe, Mistake, India 
My friend created an iPhone app that locates Vienna Beef products across the country. Personally, I came hardwired with an internal GPS that instinctively points me toward coffee shops, cupcake stores and the perfect Chicago-style dog, so I find this technology redundant.|Jen Lancaster|Dog, Coffee, Me 
Technology moves so fast and social media moves so fast because everyone wants the new thing, but also, everyone wants to be where their parents are not. Once the mom got a Facebook and a Twitter and an Instagram, I don't want to be there anymore.|Ansel Elgort|Mom, Social Media, Parents 
We no longer think of chairs as technology; we just think of them as chairs. But there was a time when we hadn't worked out how many legs chairs should have, how tall they should be, and they would often 'crash' when we tried to use them.|Douglas Adams|Time, Think, Legs 
I do think there is an important artistic component in what we do. As a technology company I've tried to really stress that.|Larry Page|Stress, Company, Think 
Doing exercise without monitoring yourself will be rare in the future of wearable technology.|Astro Teller|Future, Yourself, Exercise 
Technology is characterized by constant change, rapid innovation, creative destruction, and revolutionary products.|Marsha Blackburn|Change, Innovation, Creative 
For me, it matters that we drive technology as an equalizing force, as an enabler for everyone around the world. Which is why I do want Google to see, push, and invest more in making sure computing is more accessible, connectivity is more accessible.|Sundar Pichai|World, Me, Want 
We're building what I call 'software apartheid.' We're in the process of creating a divided society: those who can use technology on one side, and those who can't on the other. And it happens to divide neatly along economic lines.|Alan Cooper|Society, Building, Software 
As hardware doubles its density every 18-24 months, courtesy of Moore's Law, and as software eats the world, technology will replace a broad swathe of jobs outright - from burger-flippers to diagnosticians - and atomize many others from full-time positions into gigs performed by many fungible workers. Tech, in short, will eat jobs.|Jon Evans|Law, Short, World 
The period 1924 to 1929 was spent studying chemistry at the Czech Institute of Technology in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The supervisor of my thesis was Professor Emil Votocek, one of the prominent founders of chemical research in Czechoslovakia.|Vladimir Prelog|Research, Studying 
First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us - especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?|Barack Obama|Work, Change, Opportunity 
Technology is going to revolutionize almost every sector, leading to the demise of many traditional professions. Economic and political power will be determined less by a country's size than by its technological superiority.|Klaus Schwab|Power, Political 
The CIA in real life, we know, is looking for new kinds of cover. It's looking for new platforms, as they like to say, and it's trying to use the revolution in communications technology, the ability to use all sorts of corporate entities in ways that are hard to detect to get our spies in the places where they need to be.|David Ignatius|Life, Looking, Know 
Technology is changing the world it's changing our sport. It's changing the way people are following the NBA. |Adam Silver|World, People, Changing 
The biggest invention of modern time is the book. The book is a digital medium; book text is written in a different form and replicable. What it really does is it allows us to replicate cultural information, scientific technology, and information out of the human brain.|Sebastian Thrun|Time, Book, Brain 
Instead of serving special interests, Congress should focus on the big picture. Globalization and technology have completely reshaped our economy in recent decades, and if we don't respond, we're putting the future of the middle class at risk.|John Delaney|Future, Focus, Risk 
I know we're all addicted to our smartphones, and I'll say, if I forget my smartphone, I go home and get it. And so understanding how to integrate that technology into the driving experience, both the front seat and the passenger seat and the back seat, I think is very important.|Mary Barra|Home, Experience 
Great songwriting will never die - it's in the DNA of music - but what's new and exciting is pairing that with new sounds that technology is enabling us to make.|Flume|Music, Great, Die 
CIA relies on a partner's focus, linguistic agility, and cultural depth; in return, the partner benefits from CIA's resources, technology, and global view.|Michael Hayden|Focus, Partner, View 
The combination of human skills with technology will always be at the root of any solution to the future of making clothes.|Issey Miyake|Future, Clothes, Solution 
It's counterproductive to lower my price, because I have to sell more units to make up for that lost revenue. Generating brand-new products can take a long time. Improving service is typically the quickest way that I can take market share. So aligning technology strategy to better service customers becomes an essential path to revenue growth.|Mark V. Hurd|Time, Growth, Service 
Discipline may be identified neither with an institution nor with an apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application, targets; it is a 'physics' or 'anatomy' of power, a technology.|Michel Foucault|Power, Discipline, Exercise 
The introduction of new technology is always disruptive to existing markets, particularly to content/copyright owners who sell through well-established distribution channels.|Steve Blank|New, Introduction, Through

Like all tools, modern technology has produced some wonderful moments in music and also some horrors.|Hugh Hopper|Music, Moments, Tools 
Technology has changed the fan/actor interaction quite a bit. Now it's really easy to communicate with a large group of people in a really short time, and that... opens a lot of possibilities. You can do a lot of things with it that you couldn't do before. It's kind of fun to figure out how that can be employed.|Misha Collins|Time, Short, Fun 
I would absolutely love to go back to the simplicity of the '80s, where there wasn't texting, social media, iPhones, or smartphones. I love the fact that you would go home and check your messages. I'm not well suited to the world of modern technology.|Matthew Rhys|Love, Home, Social Media 
As technology improves, on-screen avatars look more and more like real people. When they start looking too real, though, we pull away. These almost-humans aren't quite right; they look creepy, like zombies.|James Surowiecki|Start, People, Looking 
Technology breeds crime and we are constantly trying to develop technology to stay one step ahead of the person trying to use it negatively.|Frank Abagnale|Step, Trying, Crime 
Today, our attention is less than the television advertisement. We're looking at six or seven problems constantly. We're living in the disturbed societies of cities. I think modern technology is one of the worst things human beings have invented.|Marina Abramovic|Today, Problems, Television 
CCTV is seen either as a symbol of Orwellian dystopia or a technology that will lead to crime-free streets and civil behaviour. While arguments continue, there is very little solid data in the public domain about the costs, quantity and effectiveness of surveillance.|Heather Brooke|Data, Public Domain 
One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.|Hector Ruiz|Helpful, Useful, Things 
When I took my first job, I was among only a handful of women. It was isolating at times. My love for technology kept me going, and I got to where I am today driven by my passion and self confidence.|Padmasree Warrior|Love, Women, Today 
In 1970, there was a single telephone company in the United States called AT&T, and its technology was called circuit switching, and that was all any telecom engineer worried about.|Vint Cerf|Company, Single, Engineer 
If women want to ensure themselves a meaningful place in the future, they need to be among those determining how the technology will be used. They need to be among those deciding whether it will be the great leveler or simply serve to worsen social divisions.|Anita Borg|Future, Women, Great 
I'm guilty of being fascinated by gadgets and toys and technology, but any penny that I spend, I try to make it be a part of what I do for a living. Because then you are forwarding. You are forwarding that art, forwarding that career ahead.|Jeff Dunham|Art, Living, Guilty 
Back in the days of Apollo, sending humans to the moon was the only viable way to get the scientific data we wanted. But now, with our computer and robotics technology, there's very little an astronaut can do on Mars that a well-designed rover can't.|Andy Weir|Moon, Data, Mars 
I don't think that technology is going to allow for greater subjugation of people. I think it's gonna give them more freedom.|Palmer Luckey|Freedom, People, Think 
The evolution of technology is, like the evolution of literature, heavily path-dependent. Culture plays a far more important role in the acceptance, adoption, and spread of technology than many of us are willing to acknowledge.|Ken Liu|Culture, Acceptance 
Well before September 11, it was understood that with modern technology, the rich and powerful will lose their near monopoly of the means of violence and can expect to suffer atrocities on home soil.|Noam Chomsky|Home, Powerful, Violence 
In 1993, Israel and North Korea were moving towards an agreement in which North Korea would stop sending any missiles or military technology to the Middle East and Israel would recognize that country. President Clinton intervened and blocked it.|Noam Chomsky|Moving, Military, Country 
There is a difference between what technology enables and what historical business practices enable.|Bill Gates|Business, Difference

Consulting offered me an opportunity to see a lot of different businesses in different regions of the world, to see how textiles were being affected by foreign competition, how technology was changing.|Mitt Romney|Opportunity, Competition 
I can tell you, Obamacare, I have been stunned by the pratfalls associated with its implementation. I simply can't understand how a president that had such an effective technology campaign and has such support among the technology community members could have put in place the implementation of Obamacare as ineffectively as he did.|Mitt Romney|Community, Support, You 
I'm sorry, it's true. Having children really changes your view on these things. We're born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. It's been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it much - if at all.|Steve Jobs|Time, Children, Changes 
Science, as opposed to technology, does violence to common sense.|Richard Dawkins|Science, Violence 
Science - or the products of science like technology - is just a way of achieving something real, something that happens, something that works.|Richard Dawkins|Science, Achieving, Products 
Aliens didn't come down to Earth and give us technology. We invented it ourselves. Therefore it can never be alienating it can only be an expression of our humanity. |Douglas Coupland|Humanity, Earth, Down 
Technology favors horrible people.|Douglas Coupland|People, Favors, Horrible 
It feels wistful to imagine a time when people didn't go about their daily routine with the assumption that at any moment another massive media technology will be dumped on us by some geek in California.|Douglas Coupland|Time, Daily, Media 
Even when you take a holiday from technology, technology doesn't take a break from you.|Douglas Coupland|Holiday, You, Break

Whatever it is that leads human beings to hate, to destroy, and to kill has taken on a collective force like never before, as technology and globalization now give it the capacity to not just strike, but to strike us all, together, as one.|Marianne Williamson|Together, Hate 
My vision is for a fully reusable rocket transport system between Earth and Mars that is able to re-fuel on Mars - this is very important - so you don't have to carry the return fuel when you go there.|Elon Musk|Vision, Earth, You 
If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilisations, and I mean strange in a bad way. And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilisations.|Elon Musk|Strange, Look, You 
Government isn't that good at rapid advancement of technology. It tends to be better at funding basic research. To have things take off, you've got to have commercial companies do it.|Elon Musk|Good, Government, Research 
A big reason why I started writing is I felt that fiction had stopped evolving. All other entertainments were getting better, constantly, as technology allowed. Movies. Video games. Music.|Chuck Palahniuk|Music, Writing, Video Games 
I am amazed at the wonders of technology and am grateful for the ways in which we are able to use it to share the Gospel around the world.|Billy Graham|Grateful, I Am, World

Technology is such a broad kind of term, it really applies to so many things, from the electric light to running cars on oil. All of these different things can be called technology.

Normally, I love to go to the movies and when I see a character portrayed by different actors at different ages, it kind of pops a little bit for me. It brings me out of the movie experience. Now we have the technology to cure that.|Jeff Bridges|Love, Experience, Character

I think that people would like to, at all times, reject death and disease with technology.|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu|Death, People, Think 
If technology and medicine are used by women to have children or not to have children or to have healthier children - that's one thing. But if it's used to say, 'You're not a real woman unless you have a child; therefore, take all these dangerous hormones and have one at 54,' then it's another story.|Gloria Steinem|Children, Women, Woman

If China someday gains a more fair, just, and accountable system of government, it will be due to the hard work and efforts of the Chinese people, not due to the inexorable workings of any particular technology.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Work, Hard Work, Government 
We like to think of the Internet as a border-busting technology.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Internet, Think, Like 
As it turns out, American-made technology had helped Mubarak and his security state collect, compile, and parse vast amounts of data about everyday citizens.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Security, Data, Citizens 
The humanists' replacement for religion: work really hard and somehow you'll either save yourself or you'll be immortal. Of course, that's a total joke, and our progress is nothing. There may be progress in technology but there's no ethical progress whatsoever.|David Bowie|Work, Progress, Religion 
I'm very good with technology, I always have been, and with machines in general. They seem not threatening like other people find them, but a source of fun and amusement.|Brian Eno|Good, Fun, People

You can't really imagine music without technology.|Brian Eno|Music, You, Without

I think that technology is always invented for historical reasons, to solve a historical problem. But they very soon reveal themselves to be capable of doing things that aren't historical that nobody had ever thought of doing before.|Brian Eno|Thought, Problem, Think 
TiVo and other digital recording devices have confounded advertisers. The ad industry sees the technology as a threat to their product.|Simon Sinek|Digital, Product, Industry 
Reading is a technology for perspective-taking. When someone else's thoughts are in your head, you are observing the world from that person's vantage point.|Steven Pinker|Reading, Thoughts, World 
Technology, ideology, and social and cultural changes periodically throw out new forms of violence for humanity to contend with.|Steven Pinker|Changes, Humanity, Violence 
The decline of violence isn't a steady inclined plane from an original state of maximal and universal bloodshed. Technology, ideology, and social and cultural changes periodically throw out new forms of violence for humanity to contend with.|Steven Pinker|Changes, Humanity, Violence 
We live in a world that relies on technology.|James Wan|World, Live 
In '83, not only was there no such thing as performance motion capture technology, there was no such thing as digital animation. This was the analog era.|Steven Spielberg|Performance, Digital

I've never been a great one for technology.|Orlando Bloom|Great, Never, Been 
It seems obvious that if a species has the brainpower for speech, along with the sort of appendages that can manipulate a pair of pliers, it will eventually blunder into science, technology, and radio.|Seth Shostak|Science, Speech, Radio 
It used to be that the only ones with access to cutting-edge technology were top government labs, big companies and the ultra-rich. It was simply too expensive for the rest of us to afford.|Peter Diamandis|Government, Rest, Big 
Regardless of what the naysayers believe about human interaction and social media, the data show us that the abundance of technology is actually increasing the abundance of happiness all over the world.|Peter Diamandis|Happiness, Social Media

Inventor: A person who makes an ingenious arrangement of wheels, levers and springs, and believes it civilization.|Ambrose Bierce|Civilization, Person, Wheels 
Telephone, n. An invention of the devil which abrogates some of the advantages of making a disagreeable person keep his distance.|Ambrose Bierce|Devil, Distance, Person 
I'm not a tech guy. I'm looking at the technology with the eyes of my customers, normal people's eyes.|Jack Ma|Eyes, People, Looking 
Practically every technology that is ever invented is touted as being the new savior, the thing that will bring peace and goodwill to the earth, but immediately it falls into other hands who see it as the opportunity to promote the very opposite.|Michael Leunig|Peace, Opportunity, Hands 
Wal-Mart uses technology to increase sales volume, but the more it does so, the more it drives down profit margins - its own and everybody else's. The same logic does not appear to hold for Goldman Sachs.|Timothy Noah|Sales, Logic, Down 
'Operation Ajax' presents history in an entirely new way. It takes a true story and uses cutting-edge technology, never before used in this way, to bring it to spectacular life.|Stephen Kinzer|Life, History, Story 
The millennials were raised in a cocoon, their anxious parents afraid to let them go out in the park to play. So should we be surprised that they learned to leverage technology to build community, tweeting and texting and friending while their elders were still dialing long-distance?|Nancy Gibbs|Community, Parents, Play 
In practice, downsizing is too often about cutting your work force while keeping your business the same, and doing so not by investments in productivity-enhancing technology, but by making people pull 80-hour weeks and bringing in temps to fill the gap.|James Surowiecki|Work, Business, People 
I like connecting with people through technology.|Theophilus London|People, Connecting, Through 
We humans usually feel that we are the best at everything we do, that we can safely drive ourselves. But tens of thousands of people die every year. We need to be open to having technology assist us, to find ways in which technology makes us safer.|Sebastian Thrun|Best, People, Drive 
What I found personally to be true was that it's easier to manipulate people rather than technology.|Kevin Mitnick|People, Be True, True 
My initial desire to blog came from something that's always been my approach to investing - I'm a nerd, and I love to play with the technology, and part of my approach has really been to understand things both at a user level and at a reasonably deep tentacle level.|Brad Feld|Love, Deep, Play 
Technology is huge; I wanted to learn about it. People might say that's odd, but I think it's odd if artists aren't interested in the world around them. I'm always chasing that.|Bono|World, People, Think 
We begin to change the world when we stimulate long-term prosperity using technology. There is not a problem that's large enough that innovation and entrepreneurship can't solve.|Naveen Jain|Change, Innovation 
I think there are going to be a bunch of tablet-like devices. It's really a different product category.|Jeff Bezos|Think, Product, Different 
Technology is teaching us to be human again.|Simon Mainwaring|Human, Teaching, Us 
Find the human in the technology. The currency marketers trade in has not changed even if the methods have. Emotion is what we exchange.|Simon Mainwaring|Emotion, Find, Human 
The benefits of our increasingly digital lives have been accompanied by new dangers, and we have been forced to consider how criminals and terrorists might use advances in technology to their advantage.|James Comey|Digital, New, Benefits 
Digital technology is both arousing and distancing. We don't look at the users on the other side as people. They aren't - they're just usernames, Facebook photos and Twitter handles.|Douglas Rushkoff|People, Digital, Look 
I am much less concerned with whatever it is technology may be doing to people that what people are choosing to do to one another through technology. Facebook's reduction of people to predictively modeled profiles and investment banking's convolution of the marketplace into an algorithmic battleground were not the choices of machines.|Douglas Rushkoff|I Am, Choices, People 
There's absolutely no bubble in technology.|Peter Thiel|Bubble, Absolutely 
If the whole U.S. was like Silicon Valley, we'd be in good shape. But now, the entire U.S. is not driven by technology, is not driven by innovation.|Peter Thiel|Good, Innovation, Shape 
I don't feel that this concept of disruptive technology is the solution for everybody. But I think it's very important for innovators to understand what we've learned about established companies' motivation to target obvious profitable markets - and about their inability to find emerging ones. The evidence is just overwhelming.|Clayton Christensen|Motivation, Solution, Think 
The arc of technology is in the direction of unbreakable encryption, and no laws are going to get in the way of that reality.|Michael Hayden|Reality, Direction, Way 
If you had a really good - battery, it wouldn't matter that the sun goes down at night and the wind stops blowing sometimes. But at the moment, battery technology is nowhere near good enough to use at utility scale.|Nathan Myhrvold|Good, Sun, Night 
The depressing thing about battery technology is that it gets better, but it gets better slowly. There are a whole bunch of problems in materials science and chemistry that come in trying to make existing batteries better.|Nathan Myhrvold|Science, Problems, Better 
The promise of the early web was that everyone could have a website but there was something missing. Maybe the technology wasn't ready.|Matt Mullenweg|Missing, Early, Website 
Business models change. As technology processes, business models change.|Marsha Blackburn|Change, Business, Processes 
'Solutionism' for me is, above all, an unthinking pursuit of perfection - by means of technology - without coming to grips with the fact that imperfection is an essential feature of liberal democracy.|Evgeny Morozov|Democracy, Perfection, Me 
Steve Jobs was notoriously blunt about products he found wanting, but his attack on Flash - Adobe's popular technology for playing multimedia content inside a browser - was particularly vicious. Claiming it was buggy and insecure, Jobs banned it from the iPad.|Evgeny Morozov|Content, Products, Jobs 
The technology available for film-making now is incredible, but I am a big believer that it's all in the story.|Robert Redford|I Am, Story, Now 
After Scour, I started a company called Red Swoosh. The idea was to take those litigants who sued us for a huge amount of money and turn them into customers with the same technology. I wanted to get them to pay me. It was a revenge business.|Travis Kalanick|Business, Money, Revenge

Tweeting is like sending out cool telegrams to your friends once a week.|Tom Hanks|Friends, Cool, Week 
I think that we're on a path that Apple was determined to be on since the '70s, which was to try and make technology relevant and personal.|Jonathan Ive|Path, Apple, Think 
It's easy to get sidetracked with technology, and that is the danger, but ultimately you have to see what works with the music and what doesn't. In a lot of cases, less is more. In most cases, less is more.|Herbie Hancock|Music, Easy, You 
Making sounds that literally no one has ever heard before because the software and the technology's never been there, and pairing that with great songwriting, then that's what's exciting for me. That's what I wanna do.|Flume|Great, Me, Software 
My first job was as a programmer. So I feel like I'm familiar with the information technology sector and the information technology culture.|Gene Luen Yang|Culture, Job, Information 
I think extreme secrecy is a bad sign in all startups. Very few startups die because they tell you exactly how their technology works. On the long list of startup killers, that's pretty far down. Though on the list of entrepreneur fears, it's pretty high.|Sam Altman|Long, Think, You 
We have promised to support India in its international aspiration. We have agreed to set up a working group on technology.|Viktor Orban|Support, Group, Working 
I used to do my best thinking while staring out airplane windows. The seat-back video system put a stop to that. Now I sit and watch old' Friends' and 'Everybody Loves Raymond' episodes. Walking is good, but here again, technology has interfered. I like to listen to iTunes while I walk home. I guess I don't think anymore.|Mary Roach|Home, Friends, Good 
Because of technology, we don't develop telepathy. We don't use telepathy, but use, you know, the mobile phones. Why?|Marina Abramovic|Know, Why, You 
If you really want to improve technology, if you want things to work better and be better, you've got to protect the person who spends a lot of effort, money, and time developing that new technology.|James Dyson|Work, Time, Money 
The wonderful thing about Apple technology is just how intuitive it is.|James Dyson|Apple, Wonderful, Just 
We understand how to build and manage businesses that involve technology, engineering, and people at a large scale on a global platform.|Azim Premji|People, Engineering, Build 
The reason steampunk attracts people is that it is premised on a technology which is visible and pleasing to the naked eye, and whose moving parts are comprehensible on a human scale.|Nick Harkaway|Eye, Moving, People 
Steampunk appeals to the idea of uniqueness, to the one-off item, while every mainstream consumer technology of recent years is about putting human beings into ever more granular, packageable and mass-produced identities so that they can be sold or sold to, perfectly mapped and understood.|Nick Harkaway|Uniqueness, Idea, Human 
The spending in science and technology need to be to increased.|Atal Bihari Vajpayee|Science, Need, Spending 
Wearable technology will tell us how well we are sleeping and whether we need to exercise. Sensors in the street will help us avoid traffic jams and find parking. Telemedicine applications will allow physicians to treat patients who are hundreds of miles away.|John T. Chambers|Treat, Help, Exercise 
Once you understand that Goliath is much weaker than you think he is, and David has superior technology, then you say: why do we tell the story the way we do? It becomes, actually, a far more meaningful and important story in its retelling than in the kind of unsophisticated way we've done it for, I think, too long.|Malcolm Gladwell|Meaningful, Long, Think 
Bringing buyers and sellers together through a single platform is not a new idea - most of us know about eBay's success - but with advancing technology comes new innovative methods for businesses to connect customers with those who want to offer services.|Sam Graves|Success, Together, Want 
I'm interested in Linux because of the technology, and Linux wasn't started as any kind of rebellion against the 'evil Microsoft empire.'|Linus Torvalds|Evil, Rebellion, Kind 
Being a club pro and all, a guy trying to keep up with golf's modern technology, I hadn't found much time for Internet dating, but then one day I knew I'd met the girl of my dreams when she replied to a comment I'd made on You-and-Me.com. She said, 'I love it when you talk equipment to me.'|Dan Jenkins|Love, Time, Dreams 
Technology allows us to do many things, but it is always important to combine it with traditional handcrafts and, in fact, use technology to replicate dying arts so that they are not lost.|Issey Miyake|Lost, Important, Dying 
All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have equal value.|Carl Sagan|Value, American, World 
We speak of 'software eating the world,' 'the Internet of Things,' and we massify 'data' by declaring it 'Big.' But these concepts remain for the most part abstract. It's hard for many of us to grasp the impact of digital technology on the 'real world' of things like rocks, homes, cars, and trees. We lack a metaphor that hits home.|John Battelle|Home, World, Trees 
We are led by lawyers who do not understand either technology or balance sheets.|Thomas Friedman|Balance, Legal, Lawyers 
Product management really is the fusion between technology, what engineers do - and the business side.|Marissa Mayer|Business, Management 
I don't understand it and haven't understood in this world of technology: where every building has a camera, every ATM has a camera, why don't we have cameras on police officers?|Rick Santelli|World, Police, Building 
Technology is neutral and sterile. Now, technology is the nature of modern man; it is our environment and our horizon. Of course, every work of man is a negation of nature, but at the same time, it is a bridge between nature and us. Technology changes nature in a more radical and decisive manner: it throws it out.|Octavio Paz|Work, Nature, Time 
All of technology, really, is about maximizing free options.|Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Free, Options, Really 
The Internet allows the small guy a global marketplace. But technology is harmful in the sense that we get too much information from it. Because of the web we get 10 times the amount of noise we ever got, which makes harmful fallacies far more likely.|Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Internet, Information, Small 
Technology has the benefit of being easily scalable. A few weeks or months of coding can result in solutions that reap huge benefits. The global success of Facebook, Twitter, and Google are all triumphs of technology.|Shawn Amos|Success, Google, Reap 
There is a lack of talent in technology, and we need to be encouraging kids in school to learn how to code. We need to encourage computer science as a major. We need to encourage entrepreneurism.|Jon Oringer|Science, School, Talent 
I started in comics in 2005, ten years ago, and at that time, I didn't have a cell phone. I don't even think I had a computer myself, you know. And just in those ten years, how much technology has changed.|Jeff Lemire|Time, Myself, Cell Phone 
I love technology - yes, I have fallen in love with older cars, but I'm all for new technology.|Mario Andretti|Love, New, New Technology 
I'm equally guilty of using technology - I Twitter, I text people, I chat. But I think there's something strangely insidious about it that it makes us think we're closer when in fact we're not seeing each other, we're not connecting.|Jason Reitman|People, Think, Guilty 
YouTube is akin to having my own network.|Marlee Matlin|YouTube, My Own, Own 
We can't blame the technology when we make mistakes.|Tim Berners-Lee|Mistakes, Blame, Make 
American women are so fortunate. When I got married, all I wanted in the world was a dryer so I didn't have to hang up my diapers. And now women have paper diapers and all sorts of conveniences in the home. And it is the man and the technology that has made the home such a pleasant place for women to be.|Phyllis Schlafly|Home, Women, Man

When designers replaced the command line interface with the graphical user interface, billions of people who are not programmers could make use of computer technology.|Howard Rheingold|People, Computer, Line 
The Amish communities of Pennsylvania, despite the retro image of horse-drawn buggies and straw hats, have long been engaged in a productive debate about the consequences of technology.|Howard Rheingold|Debate, Long, Consequences

Innovation is what we're going to need for the future, and that's always been a part of the technology industry.|Suzan DelBene|Future, Innovation, Need 
It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being.|John Stuart Mill|Day, Human, Inventions 
It's important with any new technology to try to pay conscious attention to what the drawbacks might be. We choose to multitask. Sometimes our choices aren't the wisest of choices, and we regret them, but they are our choices. I think it'd be wrong to think that they're automatically bad.|James Gleick|Regret, Choices, Think 
Every time a new technology comes along, we feel we're about to break through to a place where we will not be able to recover. The advent of broadcast radio confused people. It delighted people, of course, but it also changed the world.|James Gleick|Time, World, People 
The core concept of Samasource is essentially that technology helps us unlock human talent wherever it may happen to reside. That we should no longer be victims of the birth lottery. That no one should be stuck in a poor place where they don't have a job simply because of an accident of birth.|Leila Janah|Job, Talent, Birth 
Civilization has given us enormous successes: going to the moon, technology. But then this is the civilisation that took us to debt, environmental crisis, every single crisis. We need a civilization where we say goodbye to these things.|Muhammad Yunus|Environmental, Goodbye, Moon 
People gravitate to what they believe to be popular... Technology is enabling even more of that.|Bob Iger|Believe, People, Popular 
Technology teaches passivity. Absorbed in our devices - at any age - we are absorbed in someone else's perspective.|Julia Cameron|Age, Perspective, Someone 
Libraries function as crucial technology hubs, not merely for free Web access, but those who need computer training and assistance. Library business centers help support entrepreneurship and retraining.|Scott Turow|Business, Training, Support 
For the blue-collar worker, the driving force behind change was factory automation using programmable machine tools. For the office worker, it's office automation using computer technology: enterprise-resource-planning systems, groupware, intranets, extranets, expert systems, the Web, and e-commerce.|Tom Peters|Change, Driving, Tools 
In the technology world, you have to execute fast or you're out of business.|Vivek Wadhwa|Business, World, You 
Ask any venture capitalist, and they will tell you that they consider the experience and completeness of the founding team to be a more important factor in their investment decision than the technology that is being built.|Vivek Wadhwa|Team, Experience, Decision 
Police departments no longer have to pay overtime or divert resources from other projects to find out where an individual goes - all they have to do is place a tracking device on someone's car or ask a cell phone company for that individual's location history and the technology does the work for them.|Ron Wyden|Work, History, Car 
I can't live without my smartphone, but I really geek on coding. It's not so much technology that I like, but puzzle solving.|Sylvia Day|Live, Puzzle, Without 
A moderate tax on robots, even a temporary tax that merely slows the adoption of disruptive technology, seems a natural component of a policy to address rising inequality. Revenue could be targeted toward wage insurance, to help people replaced by new technology make the transition to a different career.|Robert J. Shiller|People, Help, Transition 
What makes the production of my work so expensive? The whole installation thing - the construction, the objects, the technology. It really adds up.|Barbara Kruger|Work, Construction, Up

Creative people are notoriously the slowest to adopt new technology.|Robert Rodriguez|Creative, People, New 
Once anthropology and geology had opened up the pre-recordkeeping darkness of humanity's long, slow, sustained infancy as suitable grounds for speculation, writers began trying to imagine human existence as it must have been with only stone-age technology.|Paul Di Filippo|Darkness, Humanity, Long 
The mandate for the CTO's office is to unleash the power of technology, data, and innovation on behalf of the nation. The CTO's office is really trying to bring best practices, possibilities, pilots, and policy advising.|Megan Smith|Innovation, Best, Power 
Television has changed the American child from an irresistable force to an immovable object.|Laurence J. Peter|American, Child, Television 
Style used to be an interaction between the human soul and tools that were limiting. In the digital era, it will have to come from the soul alone.|Jaron Lanier|Alone, Soul, Style 
Advertisers are not thinking radically enough - they look for technology to lead instead of trying the neuroscience approach and thinking about what parts of the brain haven't been activated before. These new experiences bring new capabilities to the brain.|Jaron Lanier|Thinking, Brain, Look 
What does it mean to not be alone? I've approached that question through music, technology, writing and other means.|Jaron Lanier|Music, Alone, Writing 
The latest technology is not always good for anything except to the producers of the technology.|Wendell Berry|Good, Anything, Always 
Storytelling is storytelling. You still play by the same narrative rules. The technology is completely different. I don't use one piece of technology that I used when I started directing.|James Cameron|Rules, Play, Storytelling 
I believe 3D is inevitable because it's about aligning our entertainment systems to our sensory system. We all have two eyes we all see the world in 3D. And it's natural for us to want our entertainment in 3D as well. It's just getting the technology - it's really more the business model than the technology piece. We've solved the technology. |James Cameron|Business, Eyes, World 
Making duplicate copies and computer printouts of things no one wanted even one of in the first place is giving America a new sense of purpose.|Andy Rooney|America, Purpose, Giving 
The divine wisdom which requires a division of labor has sown different abilities and tendencies in human nature and has enabled human beings to carry out the duty of establishing sciences and developing technology. The fulfillment of this duty is obligatory upon humanity as a whole, though not on every individual.|Said Nursi|Nature, Wisdom, Humanity 
I am extraordinarily fascinated by the future of technology. We are in the early infancy of technology, and we have an opportunity to guide how technology develops and integrates into our lives. I talk a lot about the 'invisible interface,' or the idea that we can utilize technology without being absorbed into a screen.|Yves Behar|Future, Opportunity, I Am 
I don't particularly enjoy watching films in 3D because I think that a well-shot and well-projected film has a very three-dimensional quality to it, so I'm somewhat sceptical of the technology.|Christopher Nolan|Quality, Enjoy, Think 
For the last 10 years, I've felt increasing pressure to stop shooting film and start shooting video, but I've never understood why. It's cheaper to work on film, it's far better looking, it's the technology that's been known and understood for a hundred years, and it's extremely reliable.|Christopher Nolan|Work, Start, Pressure 
I am fascinated by all the new technology that creates places for us to meet in what is called cyberspace. I understand what it must have meant for the rebellions in the 19th century, especially in 1830 and 1848, when the mass circulated newspaper became so important for the spreading of information.|Henning Mankell|I Am, Information, Newspaper 
I am critical of modernity giving science and technology a blank check as if it were the fountain of all truth. That is not true. And I think I may have introduced a word which has now caught on quite a bit, scientism. Science is good. It simply reports a discovery.|Huston Smith|Good, Truth, Science 
These days the technology can solve our problems and then some. Solutions may not only erase physical or mental deficits but leave patients better off than 'able-bodied' folks. The person who has a disability today may have a superability tomorrow.|Daniel H. Wilson|Today, Tomorrow, Disability 
Change creates fear, and technology creates change. Sadly, most people don't behave very well when they are afraid.|Daniel H. Wilson|Change, Fear, People 
All these experiments I've done over the years with technology have been asking whether I can tell stories that affect humans in a deeper way than I could without the technology.|Chris Milk|Done, I Can, Asking 
I make short films, little documentaries, about the co-evolution of humans and technology.|Jason Silva|Short, Short Films, Little 
My mode of presentation is short-form video - basically I create fast cut, impassioned 'idea explainers' that explode with enthusiasm and intensity as they distill how technology is expanding our sphere of possibility.|Jason Silva|Enthusiasm, Presentation 
I'm a futurist. Technology is our way out of almost every problem we have. Technology can create a new sense of community.|Hal Sparks|Community, Problem, New 
There used to be this country called the Soviet Union it's not there anymore. Our technology was better than theirs. |Tom Clancy|Better, Country, Soviet 
Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences.|Freeman Dyson|Life, God, Mother 
The telephone is a 100-year-old technology. It's time for a change. Charging for phone calls is something you did last century.|Niklas Zennstrom|Change, Time, You 
Absolutely everything undergoes evolvement - whether it's technology, journalism, the NFL, medicine.|Marv Levy|Medicine, Journalism 
It reflects a prevailing myth that production technology is no more amenable to human judgment or social interests than the laws of thermodynamics, atomic structure or biological inheritance.|Barry Commoner|Human, Social, Laws 
One of the big things coming out of healthcare reform is a thing called the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (CLASS) which is a mechanism to reimburse people staying at home for technology and services that allow them to stay at home.|Colin Angle|Home, Community, People 
The computer offers another kind of creativity. You cannot ignore the creativity that computer technology can bring. But you need to be able to move between those two different worlds.|Tadao Ando|Creativity, You, Kind 
I don't mind if somebody texts me but I'm not a big texter, the things are too small. I don't mind if they text, '7 o'clock,' that's fine, that's logistics but, 'What's up?' Get real! Pick up a phone!|Penny Marshall|Mind, Small, Me 
With today's technology, you can actually see the baby grow, move, and hear their little heart beats.|Stephen Fincher|Today, Heart, Baby 
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.|John Perry Barlow|World, Mind, Create 
I'll take transformational change any way it comes. One way to look at meditation is as a kind of intrapsychic technology that's been developed over thousands of years by traditions that know a lot about the mind/body connection. To call what happens 'the placebo effect' is just to give a name to something we don't understand.|Jon Kabat-Zinn|Change, Name, Know 
Technology has to be invented or adopted.|Jared Diamond|Adopted, Invented 
Technology is something you have to embrace because technology is part of our generation. Digital natives, for instance, are people who grew up in a world that always had the Internet and who always had smartphones. Millennials aren't too far behind: my generation of people, who were in the mix of the Internet when it first came out.|Jon Batiste|World, Internet, People 
I think it's important for people to stay human and remember that genuine human connection is more fulfilling than anything that technology has to offer. We all have it within us, and music is something that can bring that out of us.|Jon Batiste|Music, People, Remember 
This really is a merger of equals. I wouldn't have come back to work for anything less than this fantastic opportunity. This lets me combine my two great loves - technology and biscuits.|Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.|Work, Great, Opportunity

Be skeptical of concepts that divorce war from its political nature, particularly those that promise fast, cheap victory through technology.|H. R. McMaster|Nature, War, Victory 
I'm afraid I am a bit of a technophobe - a nineteenth-century man caught in the twenty-first century. But there is one piece of technology that I would especially welcome: a device to automatically balance restaurant tables on all four legs so that they don't rock back and forth.|Leonard Susskind|Man, Welcome, I Am 
People are stunned to hear that one company has data files on 185 million Americans.|Ralph Nader|People, Data, Company 
What's sort of interesting about the whole public relations disaster that is the Net, in some ways, is that the fundamentals are really good.|Meg Whitman|Good, Interesting, Disaster 
I got to get the right people in the right job. Because a lot of costs can be taken out in the context of your administration without the legislature. For example, using technology to do more with less. Using technology to fight fraud. Reorganizing and streamlining can be done within the context of the administration.|Meg Whitman|Job, Fight, People 
You can have the best technology in the world, but if you don't have a community who wants to use it and who are excited about it, then it has no purpose.|Chris Hughes|Best, Community, World

Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way, which is great. But on the other hand, when everybody has the ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic - if the audience can just do it themselves, why are they going to bother?|Thomas Bangalter|Music, Great, Magic 
ChicagoNEXT is focused on making Chicago the best possible place for technology entrepreneurs.|J. B. Pritzker|Best, Chicago, Place 
I understood the importance in principle of public key cryptography but it's all moved much faster than I expected. I did not expect it to be a mainstay of advanced communications technology.|Whitfield Diffie|Key, Expect, Faster 
Every time somebody tries to go in and reinvent what we do, it always ends up being more about technology and sets, and flash and dash, forgetting the main thing, which is interesting people saying interesting, important things.|Diane Sawyer|Time, People, Saying 
Since Stonehenge, architects have always been at the cutting edge of technology. And you can't separate technology from the humanistic and spiritual content of a building.|Norman Foster|Spiritual, Building, You 
What the country needs are a few labor-making inventions.|Arnold H. Glasow|Country, Inventions, Needs

It can help you eliminate the symptoms and experience personal growth so you can minimize future upsets and cope with depression more effectively in the future.|David D. Burns|Future, Experience, Growth 
We are already producing enough food to feed the world. We already have technology in place that allows us to produce more than we can find a market for.|Jeremy Rifkin|Food, World, Place 
For a lot of people, one of the reasons they don't like to work for founders of startups is that they can be sensitive and protective around what they've built. You have an emotional attachment to the early marketing and technology materials, and you don't want to hear that anything's wrong with them.|Lynn Jurich|Work, People, Marketing 
Advances in technology and in our understanding of illness and disease together with an expanded workforce and greater resources will allow us to provide more services to a higher quality.|John Hutton|Together, Quality 
Light-field photography is a transformational technology that needs a transformational product to introduce it. For the first time, we have a light-field camera that's going to be for everyone - not something in a huge room in a research facility.|Ren Ng|Time, Research, Photography 
With light field technology, there is a huge opportunity for creativity in photography that hasn't been available in the past.|Ren Ng|Light, Creativity 
I made physical objects because I know how to do something on the computer. That struck a chord with me: Most women of my generation have grown up with technology but lack the handmade creative skills of former generations. This is a big opportunity to fill that gap.|Brit Morin|Women, Opportunity, Me 
The great growling engine of change - technology.|Alvin Toffler|Change, Great, Engine

Because of technological limits, there is a certain amount of food that we can produce per acre. If we were to have intensive greenhouse agriculture, we could have much higher production.|Ralph Merkle|Food, Limits, Agriculture 
I've been looking at the iPod- the Apple iPod. One of the interesting things about the iPod, one of the things that people love most about it is not the technology; it's the box it comes in.|Donald Norman|Love, Apple, People 
The DJ still has the relationship with the people, I believe. I don't know to call the DJ 'the ambassadors' or what, but we still are connecting the dots, getting the good stuff and passing it on to the people. DJs still have relevance, even with the technology that elevates the DJ beyond being a selector.|Ali Shaheed Muhammad|Relationship, Good, Believe

Congress will pass a law restricting public comment on the Internet to individuals who have spent a minimum of one hour actually accomplishing a specific task while on line.|Andy Grove|Law, Internet, Congress 
I think it is inevitable that people program poorly. Training will not substantially help matters. We have to learn to live with it.|Alan Perlis|Training, People, Help 
What constrains or enables the capacity of human beings to work in groups is not so much the technology, but rather the capacity of the human brain to have and monitor social interactions.|Nicholas A. Christakis|Work, Brain, Human Brain 
I see robotic technology getting rid of the dangerous, the dirty, and the just plain boring jobs. Some people say, 'You can't. People won't have anything to do.' But we found things that were a lot easier than backbreaking labor in the sun and the fields. Let people rise to better things.|Rodney Brooks|Sun, People, Rise 
You go to a technology conference or an engineering conference, there are very few women there. At the same time it's a blessing in the fact that you do get noticed. People tend to remember you as the only woman in the room 'who said that', or the only woman in the room who was an engineer.|Padmasree Warrior|Time, Women, Woman 
We could talk, act, and dress funny. We were excused for socially inappropriate behavior: 'Oh, he's a programmer'. It was all because we knew this technology stuff that other people found completely mystifying.|Kent Beck|Funny, Dress, Behavior 
If someone is trying to skip the struggle - which is the creative job - our machines today, the technology that we have, can help the person, but it is only momentary.

The internet is a great way to get on the net.|Bob Dole|Great, Internet, Way

I'm an optimist about the power of technology to transform lives for the better.|Julius Genachowski|Power, Better, Optimist

We are finally entering an exciting time in medicine where we have the technology to custom-tailor treatment and preventive protocols just as we'd custom-tailor a suit or designer gown to one's individual body.

If you're not looking toward the future or trying to improve the current technology, you'll be left behind.|Gwynne Shotwell|Future, Looking, You

I'm sure there were times when I wish I had thought, 'Gosh, that might really embarrass mom and dad,' but our parents didn't raise us to think about them.

When my dad was badly weakened by the flu and my mom wanted to call an ambulance to take him to the emergency room, he wouldn't go unless he could shave first and change into a nice shirt and a pair of slacks.|Rich Lowry|Change, Nice, Flu 
When I turned 18, my mom, my nana and I all went and had tattoos of our favorite Bible verses put on the inside of our wrists. Mine is 1st Timothy, 4:12.|Jordin Sparks|Bible, Favorite, Inside

My mom told me to do whatever I wanted to do and don't get too anxious about it.|David Giuntoli|Me, Whatever, Anxious 
For many women, going back to work a few months after having a baby is overwhelming and unmanageable. As strange as it may seem, things get even more difficult for a working mom after the second and third baby arrive. By that time, the romance of being a modern 'superwoman' wears off and reality sets in.|Mika Brzezinski|Work, Time, Women 
I am a single mom and I'm the breadwinner and I have to work and I have to do these things and that's just the way it is. I don't think my son even knows any different.|Charisma Carpenter|Work, Son, I Am 
Aretha Franklin was a teenage mom, a musician who came from an incredibly Christian background, but there was a lot of love, which is really inspiring in a feminist way.|Beth Ditto|Love, Christian, Way 
I can't help but recall my dad and mom. Depression era kids, 8th and 9th grade educations, clawed and scratched to make a living as dairy farmers their whole life. At least two drought cycles nearly took it all away. They just worked harder, longer... and they made it.|Bob Beauprez|Life, Depression, Help 
My parents waited to have me and my sister - my dad was 43 when my mother had me, and my mom was 38. They purposefully waited until they had had their adventures in life so that we wouldn't represent the end of their freedom.|Christian Borle|Life, Freedom, Sister 
My mom worked as a pharmacist, but she is one of the best storytellers I know. My sister is a gospel and opera singer and my brother, who passed away, was a writer.|Tunde Adebimpe|Sister, Best, Brother

I was brought up bilingual, but there came a point where my mom went back to work and I got a white babysitter, so sadly I lost it. Now I can understand Spanish and put words together, but I don't speak it fluently. I'm ashamed of that.|Michael Trevino|Work, Together, Words 
It's tough growing up where I grew up. My family is very small and really tight. Just being around the neighborhood, my brothers were always around. I didn't want to be in any trouble because I knew my mom or brothers would find out. I didn't want to hurt their feelings. I just tried to do everything right.|Derrick Rose|Family, Hurt, Small 
You may earn whatever money you earn as a cricketer, but you want to play for your country. At the end of the day, you want to do something special. There are plenty of people who earn 50 crores or 100 crores as businessmen or big professionals or who are really doing well in business. But what gives pleasure to your mom and dad is the fame.|Mahendra Singh Dhoni|Business, Day, Money 
As an actress, I have put myself out there as an independent black woman, a single mom, a go-getter, a hustler who isn't afraid to survive.|LisaRaye McCoy-Misick|Myself, Woman, Black 
I don't remember my first trip, but I do remember when my mom took me to Disney World in Orlando. It wasn't the rides but Epcot Center that most fascinated me. It made me want to see those countries that are represented there for real.|Lisa Ling|World, Me, Remember 
My mom was in education, and I remember reading in one of her books about multiple intelligences - this whole theory about how there are all these different ways you can be intelligent, like eight or 10 of them or something. And one of them is emotional.|Lynn Shelton|Education, Reading, Remember 
Before 'Lucky Louie,' nobody would ever cast me to play a mom or a wife; nobody ever saw me in that role, which is weird, since that's who I really am.|Pamela Adlon|Wife, Me, Weird 
One day I went up to my mom and I said, 'Mom, can I have permission to build a 2.3-million electron-volt atom smasher - a betatron - in the garage?' And my mom stared at me, and she said, 'Sure. Why not? And don't forget to take out the garbage.'|Michio Kaku|Day, Me, Why

I remember one time when all the nuns in my Catholic grade school got around in a semicircle, me and Mom in the middle, and they said, 'Mrs. Farley, the children at school are laughing at Christopher, not with him.' I thought, 'Who cares? As long as they're laughing.'|Chris Farley|Time, Children, School 
I knew that I was a gay boy fairly early; what was interesting to me was that my mother didn't know. She made me play baseball - I had no desire to do that. I said, 'Mom, I don't like direct sunlight, I don't like bugs, I don't like grass, and I'd rather be in the house playing with your fabric samples.'|Nate Berkus|Mother, Baseball, Me 
My mom is a really good cook. We used to make dumplings together.|Jason Wu|Good, Together, Cook

My mom really inspired me. She has always taught me it's not about us, it's about what we can give back.|Bailee Madison|Me, She, Back 
I've got three sisters, five aunties, and my mom. It must have had an influence on me growing up.|Zayn Malik|Influence, Growing Up, Me

I don't have a creepy uncle, but I certainly have many, many uncles. My mom has twelve brothers and sisters, and my dad has two sisters and three brothers. Their maturity level is still hovering around fifteen when they all get together, but they're not necessarily creepy.|Martha MacIsaac|Together, Maturity 
You know, I only claim to play three instruments. My dad is a banker, but a drummer at heart; and my mom used to teach piano lessons when she was younger. So I can play some piano, play a little drums, and fake the bass - but banjo, mandolin, and guitar are my thing.|Charlie Worsham|Heart, Guitar, Fake 
My mom has beautiful eyes, and I inherited a lot of her rituals, accentuating eyes.|Allison Williams|Beautiful, Eyes, Her

People may not know this about me, but I've always loved cooking. My favorite thing to cook is my mom's spicy spaghetti.|Becky G|Cooking, Me, People

I used to read music books when I was 13. My mom was working at a library. She's a librarian. I would get my mom to check out any kind of books that had anything to do with the music industry. I read a lot about royalities, publishing, marketing, stuff like that.|Juicy J|Music, Library, Marketing 
My mom sent me money for a car, but the cops impounded it because I had no insurance.|Martin Henderson|Money, Car, Me 
My mom always taught me to put toothpaste on pimples to dry them out at night. I do that all the time. I don't use anything fancy when I get a pimple.

My mom's best friend growing up was diagnosed with AIDS, and he basically raised me when my mom was launching her business. Although I didn't understand at the time what HIV or AIDS was, I knew that's what he passed away from.|Solange Knowles|Business, Time, Best Friend 
When I was 13, I would come visit my aunt and uncle in New York. I decided I wanted to live with them after seeing my cousin's school. Honestly, I just wanted to go to a school where I didn't have to wear uniforms, and my mom said okay.|Priyanka Chopra|School, New York, Live 
Having children is not for everyone, but I think it's a beautiful lesson in it not being all about me anymore. It's a relief, in a way. It's like, this is her story now, and I'm her mom. It's a nice shift.|Lake Bell|Children, Beautiful, Me 
My mom is incredibly stylish, and she gets it from my grandmother. I feel like I can't live up to how chic they are as women. They are great role models for aging gracefully, and that's a thing that is very key that I try to always emulate.|Lake Bell|Women, Great, Live 
My parents know I was outgoing as a child, and whenever people came over, I'd automatically do impressions of them as soon as they left; it was my mom's favorite thing. Yes, I grew up in Hollywood, but not in any rich neighborhood.|Leonardo DiCaprio|Parents, Child, Rich 
My mom, Nellie, got me a rosary at church. I don't use it to pray before a competition. I'll just pray normally to myself, but I have it there in case.|Simone Biles|Myself, Competition, Me 
I had a lot of energy, and my mom decided to look for a place where I can spend the energy, because I was jumping on the couch and furniture, and I was jumping on the top of the things in the house.|Nadia Comaneci|Energy, Look, Place 
At a show, I'll look out from the stage and see a woman with a pearl necklace next to a guy in a Grateful Dead T-shirt next to a young kid with his mom. It's fun to see them all together.|Hiromi Uehara|Together, Grateful, Woman 
It was the late '70s when my parents met. My dad was a lighting director for a soap opera, and my mom was a temp at the studio. They moved into a house in The Valley in L.A., to a neighborhood that was leafy and affordable.|Meghan Markle|Parents, Late, Neighborhood 
At the start of each week, I generally cook a box of quinoa, and while it's simmering, I saute onions, garlic and any veggies I have on hand in a separate pan. I season the vegetables with Spike, a seasoning blend my mom always used when I was growing up, or a little Bragg Liquid Aminos. I always add crushed red pepper and chopped fresh herbs.|Meghan Markle|Growing Up, Week, Red 
I'm like every waitress in every diner I'm like every mom driving her kids to school. I'm nothing special at all. |Katherine Dunn|School, Driving, Her 
Dad told me that before I was born, he would put my mom's stomach up to the speaker and play Led Zeppelin.|Thomas Rhett|Me, Play, Born 
I like superheroes who are very human and underdog. That's why I relate to my character in 'A Flying Jatt': because he is a very normal person and very human. He was very unsure about his super powers; he didn't know how to use them. He is scared of heights, speed. Especially he is scared of his mom, but he has to listen to her.|Tiger Shroff|Character, Flying, Speed 
There was always an unspoken generosity about my mom.|Matt Lauer|Generosity, Always, About 
I didn't grow up with a lot of money, so my mom didn't have random money to buy me a car, and I didn't have money to have a car unless I worked, so I didn't get a car until I got my first job at 18.|Dominick Cruz|Money, Car, Job 
My dad and mom were in bands: the Soda Jerks, Fat Time, Girls at Play - which is a play on Men at Work.|Sia|Work, Time, Men 
My mom named me Pom because she said it sounded like a combination of Korean words that mean 'spring' and 'tiger.' So, it's very unique!|Pom Klementieff|Words, Me, Spring 
It was so weird that I would end up directing 'The Greatest Game Ever Played,' because, y'know, I'm not a big golfer myself. But I grew up around the game. My mom and dad kind of built their dream house off the 11th fairway of Shady Oaks Country Club in Fort Worth.|Bill Paxton|Myself, End, Greatest 
Marvin Gaye is an inspiration to me. He was one of the first Motown musicians that my mom and dad introduced me to, and I always thought it would be a good idea if I was ever an artist, and now I am, to make a record called 'Marvin Gaye.'|Charlie Puth|Good, I Am, Artist 
I didn't understand that I could sing until I was like 11 or 12. My mom heard me singing around the house and she said, What are you doing? You really can sing! So then I started going to school and singing to the girls.|Chris Brown|School, Me, Singing 
My mom is going to kill me for talking about sleeping with people. But I don't want to put myself in the position where I'm in a monogamous relationship right now. I'm not dating just one person. 'Sex and the City' changed everything for me because those girls would sleep with so many people.|Lindsay Lohan|Relationship, Myself, Sleep

There's been times when I've had heartbreaking moments and I'm like, 'I can't believe you said that,' or 'I can't believe you did that'. And it hurts, it still hurts, and it'll always hurt, but I've never had somebody that I truly cared about just walk out on me, whether it was a boyfriend, or an aunt, mom or dad.|Shailene Woodley|Believe, Hurt, Walk 
My mom and dad passed away from cancer. Within nine months, I lost both of my folks. Immediately after that, I had a horrible betrayal where my brother, who worked for me, stole a lot of my money. He's in jail now.|Dane Cook|Money, Brother, Me

I promised my mom that if, after a year of putting 150 percent into my career it didn't work out, I would go back to school. I never did go back.|Queen Latifah|Work, School, Career 
I warm up with my mom and make sure I understand what the songs are about and make sure I'm using the right technique. To be honest with you, I really don't practice a lot... Usually, I say a prayer and ask the Lord to sing with me and help me and stand on the stage with me.|Jackie Evancho|Prayer, Me, Help 
My mom is big on moisturizer and water. She always reminds me to drink a lot of water and wear sunglasses because I always forget them when I go out, even though they are one of my favorite accessories. She always reminds me about wrinkles, and always did, so it's kind of been ingrained into me.|Brittany Snow|Water, Me, Sunglasses 
People still ask my husband and me which of us is the mom - which, as one lesbian friend pointed out to me, is like asking which chopstick is the fork. This pressure on us to embody normative traditions can be paralysing.|Andrew Solomon|Friend, Me, People 
I am so blessed. I have an incredible wife, children I adore; I'm a very happy man. I've got a great mom and dad and brothers and sisters and stuff, so I've always been happy. And I never stop smiling.|Michael Kelly|Children, Happy, Great 
I'm a real stay-at-home mom. I'm really hands-on. Everything else became secondary.|Drew Barrymore|Real, Everything

Having a mom as a hairdresser was really awesome: I was always her test dummy. I've had every style, every color you could imagine.|Alessia Cara|Style, Color, Awesome 
I know a lot of people who really aren't beautiful because their attitudes are very nasty... Whether I make the 50 most beautiful list or not, I'm always going to feel like I'm number one most beautiful to myself... I get that from my mom, and my daddy and my friends who raised me.|Queen Latifah|Friends, Beautiful, Myself 
I read that John Hughes script for 'Mr. Mom,' and I thought, 'This guy is a funny writer.' I went: 'You ought to stick around and direct this thing.' But he didn't; he left, and look what he became. A really legendary comedy director.|Michael Keaton|Funny, Thought, You 
My mom had Julia Child and 'The Fannie Farmer Cookbook' on top of the refrigerator, and she had a small repertoire of French dishes.|Anthony Bourdain|Child, Small, She

My dad died when I was young; my mom remarried with more haste than sense to a fellow... he wasn't evil or anything, but he was worthless.|P. J. O'Rourke|Evil, Young, Haste 
I'm too tough and sensitive to have to have some pubescent twerp with his mom's earring in his tongue, who combs his hair with Redi-Whip and has an Ani DiFranco tattoo on his shin, come show me how a computer works.|P. J. O'Rourke|Hair, Me, Tongue 
I just wasn't cut out to be a Chinese Tiger Mom. I'm more of an Irish Setter Dad.|P. J. O'Rourke|Tiger, Just, Irish 
When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?'|Mitt Romney|Beautiful, Women, Great 
I love my dad. It's fair to say that I probably would not have thought of politics had I not seen my mom and dad involved in politics.|Mitt Romney|Love, Politics, Thought 
My guess is that my mom and dad are very actively involved in the affairs of the next life, and they don't spend too much time looking back. My dad used to say he always looks forward; he never looks back.|Mitt Romney|Life, Time, Looking Back 
My mom and I have always been really close. She's always been the friend that was always there. There were times when, in middle school and junior high, I didn't have a lot of friends. But my mom was always my friend. Always.|Taylor Swift|Friends, School, Friend 
When I was younger we had a grape arbor, and my mom would go out and pick grapes and make grape jam in the sink - boil it, put it in jars, and give it away as gifts.|Taylor Swift|Grapes, Gifts, Younger 
I've been my mom's kitchen helper since I was a little kid.|Taylor Swift|Kitchen, Kid, Little

My question about luging is, How do you get into the luge community to begin with? Is it one day like, 'Mom, Dad, I really want to luge.' And your parents are like: 'O.K., I'll quit my job. We'll move to an Alpine community.'|Douglas Coupland|Day, Community, Parents 
My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful. Because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them.|Marco Rubio|Impossible, Successful, Rich 
My parents were working class folks. My dad was a bartender for most of his life, my mom was a maid and a cashier and a stock clerk at WalMart. We were not people of financial means in terms of significant financial means. I always told them, 'I didn't always have what I wanted. I always had what I needed.' My parents always provided that.|Marco Rubio|Life, Parents, Financial 
It wasn't so long ago that I was a working mom myself. And I know that sometimes, much as we all hate to admit it, it's just easier to park the kids in front of the TV for a few hours, so we can pay the bills or do the laundry or just have some peace and quiet for a change.|Michelle Obama|Change, Peace, Myself 
As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids.|Michelle Obama|Best, Parents 
Our life before moving to Washington was filled with simple joys... Saturdays at soccer games, Sundays at grandma's house... and a date night for Barack and me was either dinner or a movie, because as an exhausted mom, I couldn't stay awake for both.|Michelle Obama|Life, Simple, Moving 
My dad was an autoworker, my mom was a clerk. Until I was thirty-five, I never made more than fifteen thousand dollars a year.|Michael Moore|Never, Made, Year

My mom and I are very close.|Lady Gaga|Close, Very 
No press, no television. If my mom calls and says, 'Did you hear about?' I don't want to know nothing about anything that is going on in relation to music. I shut it all off.|Lady Gaga|Music, Television, Want 
When I was a kid, there were no credit cards. Instead, retailers offered layaway plans. My mom would go to a store, such as a furniture outlet, choose the sofa she wanted, and put it on layaway. That meant she put a little money down to hold the sofa, and every payday she'd pay a little toward the purchase.|Robert Kiyosaki|Money, Cards, She 
My mom loved rock 'n roll. My father hated it. We couldn't play it when he was around.|Patti Smith|Father, Loved, Play 
I'm a human being, I'm a friend, I'm a mom, I'm a writer, and I'm an artist. I do play electric guitar and all of that, but in the end, I'm just a person.|Patti Smith|End, Guitar, Artist 
I think my love of journalizing my life comes from my mom.|Jeff Bridges|Love, Life, My Life 
My mom wasn't a movie star.|Jeff Bridges|Star, Movie Star, Movie 
When I was really young, my mom enrolled me in dance classes.|Jeff Bridges|Dance, Me, Young 
How simple a thing it seems to me that to know ourselves as we are, we must know our mothers names.|Alice Walker|Simple, Me, Know 
My parents met because my father was an actor friend of one of my mom's brothers, but my mother has never set foot on the stage - she's quite shy. So it's a strange thing because people say, 'Oh, coming from acting parents,' when the idea of acting would literally make my mother just want to throw up.|Kate Winslet|Father, Mother, Parents 
My mom had very low expectations for me, and she really had a point. I was a big problem at seventeen. If I had a kid like me, I would have those same expectations.|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu|Expectations, Me, Problem 
I can honestly say, after talking about my mom passing away, I got the biggest weight off of my chest. Comedy is my therapy. That's how I deal with my problems, my personal battles. I talk about it. I give it to my fans. When they laugh at it, it's a release, for lack of a better word.|Kevin Hart|Problems, Laugh, Better 
My mom was very strict. She didn't let me watch anything rated R or anything with cussing.|Kevin Hart|Me, She, Anything 
Being in Australia, I was really sun conscious. For a couple of summers there, I did the baby oil thing, and my my mom said, 'Just don't. You'll regret it.'|Cate Blanchett|Baby, Sun, Regret 
I'm frugal. I've always been this way. When I was young, my mom would give me my allowance, and I'd peel off a little each week and have some to spare.|Tyra Banks|Week, Me, Young 
My mom never taught me to be waiting for some prince on a white horse to swipe me off my feet.|Tyra Banks|Waiting, Horse, Me 
My mom read French 'Elle' when I was a little girl, and so, when I was 15 or 16, I said, 'I want to work in fashion.'|Carine Roitfeld|Work, Girl, Fashion 
Sometimes you think you aren't a good mama you always feel a bit guilty when you're a mom. You want to be everywhere. |Carine Roitfeld|Good, Want, Think 
I'm not bothered by the idea of getting old, or I guess you could say by having arrived at old. I was 10 when my mom turned 55. For 1955, she was a very old mom.|Penn Jillette|She, You, Getting Old 
My mom, if you asked her if she was interested in whether or not people gambled, would say no.|Penn Jillette|People, She, You 
My mom and dad were divorced, and although they got along very well, my mom thought American television was reprehensible, so I was raised on the BBC. I kind of agreed with her. We watched American news, though.|Joss Whedon|American, Television 
I kept telling my mom that reading comic books would pay off.|Joss Whedon|Reading, Pay, Comic 
I'd go to, like, six different schools in one year. We were on welfare, and my mom never ever worked.|Eminem|Never, Welfare, Year 
Language-wise, my mom and dad's dialect, they're pretty obscure. It's Chinese, but not your traditional Chinese, like Cantonese or Mandarin. It wasn't something that I got to use very much growing up. We eventually just spoke English around the house.|James Wan|Growing Up, Growing, House 
There were times my mom and I butted heads - over my curfew, over something like that. Whenever we would hit these moments of emotional backfire, she would say, 'You just don't understand what it's like to be a mother... I could never handle losing you.' I was like, 'OK, but just, like, chill out.'|Brie Larson|Mother, Losing, Moments 
We had very few things. I had a couple pairs of jeans, a couple shirts. And same with my mom and sister. I think my sister had, like, two toys. We were living off of instant noodles.|Brie Larson|Sister, Living, Think 
I was 3 when I told my mom that I knew what my dharma was and that I wanted to be an actor.|Brie Larson|Actor, Knew, Wanted 
I was home-schooled, was always very close with my mom and was very straight-laced and square. I was never the rebellious one, and I never threw hissy fits.|Brie Larson|Never, Rebellious, Always 
When I was seven, I had been very vocal about wanting to be an actor. And my mom decided that we would try it out for a couple weeks and come to L.A. from Sacramento.|Brie Larson|Actor, Try, Wanting 
We lived in just a studio apartment with just a room and a bed that came out of the wall, and my mom couldn't afford even a Happy Meal. We ate Top Ramen. I had no toys, and I had, like, two shirts, a pair of jeans, and that was it. But I had my mom to myself, and I remember it being the coolest period of time. I loved it. I really loved it.|Brie Larson|Time, Happy, Myself 
I didn't realise how hard it was to be a mom and keep it all together.|Brie Larson|Together, Keep, Hard 
I was home-schooled, was always very close with my mom, and was very straight-laced and square. I was never the rebellious one, and I never threw hissy fits.

For years, my mom dated a man who was really active in the Baptist church in the town next to the town I grew up in, and so he used to drag me to these Baptist church services that lasted forever. I remember that I didn't like the church services, but I really liked the music.|Moby|Music, Man, Me

My mom and dad always taught acting, so instead of getting me babysitters, they would just bring me to class.|Blake Lively|Me, Acting, Bring

Okay, fluoride in the water to help our teeth. Well, shouldn't that be the job of your mom and dad? To teach you how to brush your teeth and use mouth wash? What do we need the government to do it for? Clearly, what a scam. Fluoride in the water.|Jesse Ventura|Water, Job, Government 
If I were to work with my mom, I probably would not want her to play my mom. That would get too real.|Zooey Deschanel|Work, Want, Play 
My nursery school did a production of 'The Three Little Pigs.' I played the third pig. When the wolf knocked on my door, I refused to get up and answer it because, to me, he was knocking the wrong way. I just lay there, snoring away on stage, fully immersed in my character. My dad turned to my mom and said: 'Dustin Hoffman.'|Zooey Deschanel|Character, School, Wolf

My life started on the banks of the Boyne in County Meath. Navan is the name of the town; only me, Mom, Dad.|Pierce Brosnan|Life, Me, Name 
I made some truly awful movies. 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' was the worst. If you ever want someone to confess to murder just make him or her sit through that film. They will confess to anything after 15 minutes.|Sylvester Stallone|Movies, Want, You 
Whenever I don't get injured, the film is a dud. I didn't bleed on 'Rhinestone.' I didn't bleed on 'Stop! Or My Mom will Shoot.'|Sylvester Stallone|Film, Stop, Will 
I don't want a life without my mom in it, but I'm not someone who curls up in the fetal position and says, 'Mommy, take care of me!' I don't like people catering to me. It feels so awkward and uncomfortable.|Khloe Kardashian|Life, Me, People 
I've always wanted to have kids. I do think I would be a great mom.|Khloe Kardashian|Great, Think, Kids 
I didn't go to many movies. My mom would make a family outing and bring chicken in the theater. Smell up the whole place. The most impactful movies were 'Godfather II' and 'Scarface'.

I am criticizing a culture that has sold the big lie that 'Mom doesn't matter.'|Mike Pence|Culture, I Am, Lie 
There were evictions that I saw that I know I'll never forget. In one case, the sheriff and the movers came up on a house full of children.

One of the most important things for me is my hair. I've always been about my hair, and I love that my mom and my nana taught me how to take care of it myself.

My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be sick anymore,' and she said 'Why?' and I said 'Because an angel told me so.' Now, I don't remember saying it; that's just what she told me.|Prince|Day, Mother, Me 
We come from fallible parents who were kids once, who decided to have kids and who had to learn how to be parents. Faults are made and damage is done, whether it's conscious or not. Everyone's got their own 'stuff,' their own issues, and their own anger at Mom and Dad. That is what family is. Family is almost naturally dysfunctional.|Chris Pine|Family, Parents, Anger 
My nana was an actress, my mom was an actress, and my sister, too. So because I was surrounded by it, it really came naturally.|Chris Pine|Sister, Surrounded, Actress

I remember that at the beginning of the month, the kind of menus my mom and father would prepare for us would have fish, chicken.

I have spoken honestly about being born into a home where there was discord and chaos. I saw my mom have a rough time with my dad being very controlling, which is why I push back whenever I feel like someone is trying to box me in. It makes me run for the hills.|Christina Aguilera|Time, Home, Me 
I remember watching the Grammys and looking at the performances and crying to my mom, saying how much I wanted to be there.|Christina Aguilera|Looking, Remember, Saying 
My mom brought me up to believe that my talent is a gift and a blessing.|Christina Aguilera|Believe, Gift, Me

My mom has gone out of her way in her personal life. She's been with me on the road. She's had to deal with people giving her the 'that's the mom' and arguing. Just little things as a businesswoman.|Christina Milian|Life, Little Things, Road 
I like a family guy. He must be fun, must like to go out, and has to respect his mom... my family is very important, so it should be likewise for him.|Christina Milian|Family, Respect, Fun 
From singing to acting to songwriting to mom to fashion designer! It's been quite an evolution.|Christina Milian|Fashion, Singing, Evolution

My mom is still yelling at me because she needs more autographed pictures.|Ashton Kutcher|Me, She, Pictures 
My mom's whole side of the family, they're all Packers fans. My mom's a Bears fan. My stepdad is a Vikings guy. So that gets ugly. My mom sits upstairs watching the Bears game; he sits in the basement. They can't watch it together. Football's a violent anger in our family dynamic.|Ashton Kutcher|Family, Football, Together 
If you think back to the first sporting event you went to, you don't remember the score, you don't remember a home run, you don't remember a dunk. You remember who you were with. Were you with your mom, your dad, your brother, on a date?|Mark Cuban|Home, Brother, Remember 
There's nothing more frustrating than when fans use a nickname. That's like people you don't know using names from people that you're intimate with. Like if my mom has a nickname and a fan finds it out and starts using it, that's creepy.|Evangeline Lilly|People, Know, You 
People were fed up with reality shows about midgets getting married and weird Jerry Springer talk shows. There had been a real dry spell of intelligent family-oriented viewing: the type of program that Mom, Dad and the kids can all watch together. With 'Lost,' there are just so many characters for people to invest in.|Evangeline Lilly|Together, Reality, Lost 
I will share a personal experience: my father was posted in Jammu & Kashmir during the Kargil war. I remember my mom sitting in front of television throughout the day reading tickers which had name of the martyrs.|Anushka Sharma|Day, Father, Experience

I think my mom exposed me to the concept of using your voice for anything you care about.|Laura Dern|Me, Voice, Think 
I'll tell you, Liz Cheney is going to be a very good candidate. I worked with her during the Bush campaigns. She's smart, she's focused, she's disciplined - and she's got a great back story. She's got a large family. She's a great mom. And she's a hard worker. I think she's going to be a very effective campaigner.|Mark McKinnon|Family, Good, Great 
The only reason I felt like I could sing a song like 'Blown Away' is because I have definitely lived through my fair share of trips to the cellar in the spring. We were no stranger to that. I still ask my mom, 'Is the cellar cleaned out now? Is everything OK?' Even in my new house, I had something built in it that's like a storm shelter.|Carrie Underwood|Storm, Song, Spring 
My mom had a job, and she also took care of us, and she also took care of Dad - I always saw her pulling triple duty, doing more than I ever felt like she needed to.

There were definitely bands and musicians I liked that drove my mother insane. I probably liked them all the more for it! Bjork drove my mom nuts. What I listened to was actually pretty mom-friendly for the most part. I wasn't very rebellious.|Gillian Jacobs|Mother, Musicians, Insane 
I was a different kind of player as a kid and didn't do too much shouting and screaming. If things didn't go my way, I tended to get a bit overwhelmed. All I wanted to do was cry on my mom's shoulder. I didn't know how to handle defeat in front of a crowd, and I didn't want to be the loser.|John McEnroe|Want, Defeat, Know 
I am grateful for the lessons I learned from my parents' sacrifices. They often had trouble making ends meet, so we moved for them to find work. I remember my mom would sometimes take on second jobs, like ironing, just so we could buy groceries.|Rick Scott|Work, Parents, I Am 
My mom never went to college, but for her own children, getting a great education was not an option.|Rick Scott|Education, Children, Great

I'm really in touch with my Italian roots. My mom's whole side of the family is there.|Alessia Cara|Family, Roots, Italian 
As a kid, my parents would always listen to a lot of Beatles, Queen, Elvis.

There are a lot of people who helped make Queen Latifah who she is today. I don't forget, but a lot of people do and get big heads.

I had some interesting costumes... the one that I remember right offhand is Zorro when I was a lot younger. I was a big time Zorro fan.

My wife is so very important to me that it's made my mom more important to me. It's made every woman I know more important to me.|Jason Isbell|Woman, Wife, Me 
My wife and I both grew up with parents who were very young. Her mom was, I think, 17 or 18 when she was born; my mom was 15 when I was born. So, as we got older, we started thinking a lot about that - about the time that those people missed because we came along when we did and because they devoted so much of their lives to taking care of us.|Jason Isbell|Time, Parents, Wife

Mom cooked a lot of turkey when I was growing up. Turkey meatloaf, turkey burgers, ground turkey shepherd's pie - my childhood was the Bubba Gump of turkey.

There's no one else I would rather have as my manager than my mom because I know that she has our best interests at heart. Sometimes, it's hard to separate manager mode from mom mode.

My mom is one of my role models in a complicated way. I learned from her how to be a good mom. She was one of those natural moms who really took to it. Her chosen profession was teaching.

The debt ceiling at some point has to be raised.

To find a prince, you gotta kiss some toads.|Foxy Brown|Kiss, You, Find 
It's ironic, really. Guys should be excited that I got Kristen Bell. If Brad Pitt gets Kristen Bell, it's like, 'Well, of course he did.'

But guys hate my guts for always dating women I have no right to be with.|Dax Shepard|Women, Good, Hate

I enjoy dating. I love first dates. I think they're incredibly fascinating studies in human psychology.

I can't even explain to you how terrible that feels, that I equate dating a woman with punishment, shame, guilt, disappointment, reproach, reprimand, persecution. It's a nightmare.|John Mayer|Woman, Disappointment, Guilt 
I urge you children to be patient with your parents. If they seem to be out of touch on such vital issues as dating, clothing styles, modern music, and use of family cars, listen to them anyway. They have the experience that you lack.|Joseph B. Wirthlin|Family, Music, Children 
I've always been intellectually restless, but it is the building part of it that most interests me. It is the constructing of the team that is my favorite part.

As I've told Tyler, there's not a really easy place between being single and being married for us now. We're just so busy that the logistics of our career make dating impossible.

Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutually accepted delusion.|Kim Cattrall|Foundation, Relationships

I change my mind so much I need two boyfriends and a girlfriend.|Pink|Change, Mind, Girlfriend

Well, dating has become a sport and not about finding the person you love.|Rashida Jones|Love, Finding, You 
The rich are different. Their wants are very high maintenance. They'll pick eye color and hair color, all the way down to what she does for a living, what school she went to. Their list can be extremely long. But at the end of the day, dating is dating, because they're human beings.|Patti Stanger|Day, School, Color

There are some guys you definitely would not want dating your sister - especially hockey players.|Patrick Kane|Sister, Hockey, Want 
With the release of her fourth album, 'Red,' in 2012 and a handful of highly publicized romances, Taylor was criticized by the press and other entertainers for such sinful acts as dating people and writing songs about it, gaining a reputation as boy-crazy and love-ridden.|Tavi Gevinson|Writing, Red, People 
I like the idea of dating, but I'm not dating anyone exclusively, particularly right now. It's hard to be in a relationship unless you're ready to go public with it. So it's a lot easier for me to not be in a relationship. I really don't want that part of my life to be tabloid fodder.|Cory Monteith|Life, Relationship, Me 
For me, I've learned if I want a very stable, normal relationship, where I'll be like, 'Okay, this is nice, I know what's going to happen in a month,' it's probably better to date outside the industry. But you can't help who you fall for. It's our dating pool.|Camila Cabello|Relationship, Help, Fall 
Taylor Swift dates guys so she can write a breakup song about them. I don't think she's dating for love - I think she's dating for creativity. So let's get her off the market and put her in dating detox. If she really wants love, she has to stop writing music about them.|Patti Stanger|Love, Music, Creativity 
I'm doin' something different. I mean, I talk a little bit about race and interracial dating, but it's not the heart of my act. I just try to do what I think is funny; there's no huge message or through line.|Hannibal Buress|Funny, Heart, Think 
That's the awful thing about dating. Tight underwear. We would all like to be in a big bra and pants and when you are in a secure relationship you can do that.|Dawn French|Relationship, You, Secure 
You know, I had my mother and my father convincing me that he would be going back to Hollywood and he'd be back with the actresses and dating them and that he wasn't serious about me at all.

I'm not the girl who always has a boyfriend. I'm the girl who rarely has a boyfriend.|Taylor Swift|Girl, Always, Boyfriend 
I'm the girl who - I call it girl-next-door-itis - the hot guy is friends with and gets all his relationship advice from but never considers dating.|Taylor Swift|Relationship, Friends, Girl 
You can draw inspiration from anything. If you're a good storyteller, you can take a dirty look somebody gives you, or if a guy you used to have flirtations with starts dating a new girl, or somebody you're casually talking to says something that makes you so mad - you can create an entire scenario around that.|Taylor Swift|Good, Girl, You 
I'm typically single. I'm the girl who - I call it girl-next-door-itis - the hot guy is friends with and gets all his relationship advice from but never considers dating.|Taylor Swift|Relationship, Friends, Girl 
I'm really critical of my posture, it makes a big difference. And I try to suck my belly in. Everyone should do that whether you're on a red carpet or not. Even if you're just going out to dinner with your boyfriend you should try and suck it in.|Katy Perry|Red, Dinner, You

'Dating Game' wasn't social commentary, political analysis, Shakespearean-level drama or even blunt-force comedy. It was just the televised equivalent of meeting someone at a bar. But it appealed to our most basic Darwinian instinct: selecting a good mate. You can't go wrong when a show's premise is hard-wired into human DNA.|Seth Shostak|Good, Political, Game 
Ever since the infamous quiz show scandals of the 1950s, the feds had insisted that TV game shows be honest - or that at least they didn't cheat. So as a 'Dating Game' bachelor, I didn't know what I was going to be asked. The other bachelors and I were required to concoct our answers in real time.|Seth Shostak|Time, Game, Know

I tried to tell them about the dating process because I'm single now and how horrible it is and how many foolish experiences I had had dating. So I was really selling him hard, but the whole time he really wanted me!|Andie MacDowell|Time, Me, Selling 
I do like dating cynics - they tend to be incredibly funny.|Chris Pine|Funny, Like, Tend

First and foremost when you're doing comedy, you gotta be relevant and applicable to the times that you're living in. When you try and just do comedy about who is dating who and lifestyle jokes, it gets tiring after a while. It's hard to be funny in that realm.|Adam McKay|Funny, Living, You 
I know some people who've gotten tattoos that they probably shouldn't have, like the name of somebody they were dating, and that never ends well.|Nikki Sixx|People, Name, Know

Golf and dating don't mix.|Larry David|Golf, Mix 
I was single for a while and dating and... I just didn't know how to do it! I've always been like that: when I was 15, there was a guy I liked, and we made out, and I thought that meant he was my boyfriend.|Winona Ryder|Thought, Know, Single

I'm not a dating person.|Kourtney Kardashian|Person

I give dating advice on a regular basis. It's not that I'm any expert, but it's always nice to share that with your friends.|Ashley Tisdale|Friends, Advice, Nice

Things were a lot simpler in Detroit. I didn't care about anything but boyfriends.|Madonna Ciccone|Care, Anything, Things

I'm never going to say anything about who I'm dating unless I'm married or engaged.|Kirsten Dunst|Never, Say, Anything

I don't have the best dating track record.|Lauren Conrad|Best, Track, Track Record 
Dating is all about the chase. It's fun!|Lauren Conrad|Fun, Chase, About

The thing about dating someone who listens to a totally different genre than you is they can help you find things to appreciate in that genre.|Hannah Simone|Help, Appreciate, You

When someone is good, but it doesn't seem like their world will collapse if they don't get the part, it's more appealing. It's like dating someone: You don't want someone who's too into you.|Steve Carell|Good, World, Want 
Dating is... weird.|Jennifer Coolidge|Weird 
I have 20,000 girlfriends, all around the world.|Justin Timberlake|World, Girlfriends, Around 
When my parents were dating, they were very poor, so my dad couldn't take my mom out. They would go to the grocery store and pick out funny looking vegetables. When I grew up, we'd still go and find the ones with personality.|Parker Posey|Funny, Mom, Parents 
I don't understand the whole dating thing. I know right off the bat if I'm interested in someone, and I don't want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if I know I'm not interested in that person.|Britney Spears|Money, Me, Want 
I have a distinct memory, dating back to 1989 or so, of sitting around with my college dorm mates talking about a new term that was popping up everywhere: 'political correctness.'|Meghan Daum|College, Memory, Political

I wouldn't tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people, and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life. I would never tell you if I was dating anybody.|Kristen Stewart|Life, People, Entertainment

All men that date me have to know that their name may end up in a pop song.|Kesha|Men, End, Me

It's lonely. That's why, in many ways, the CIA is the world's biggest dating agency, I think. I imagine it's much like two actors that get married because they understand that universe. You know, I'm pretty sure the agency's divorce rate is rather high.|Valerie Plame|World, Universe, Lonely 
We have known Hillary Clinton both professionally and personally for close to 20 years, dating back to before President Bill Clinton's first trip to Africa in 1998 - a trip that they both acknowledge changed their lives and gave considerable meaning to their post-White House years and to the activities of the Clinton Foundation.|Valerie Plame|Foundation, Meaning, Africa 
I'm dating myself by saying this, but I was the test audience for 'Space Invaders.' I remember when that was the first game that wasn't a pinball game. I spent a lot of money on 'Space Invaders,' in the form of quarters, of course.|John C. Reilly|Money, Myself, Space 
I'm a South Asian female that talks about relationships and periods and dating and all these things.|Lilly Singh|Relationships, Asian, Female 
The thing is, in the dating profiles it says 'spiritual,' but not with a specific religion. And so I pretty much try to meditate, but I have a very hard time concentrating on things other than me.|Lisa Lampanelli|Time, Spiritual, Religion 
I'm way too famous and rich to be on a dating app, but if I get very desperate by the time I'm 60, I'll go on Tinder. Or I'll go on 'Millionaire Matchmaker'; I'll call Patti Stanger.|Lisa Lampanelli|Time, Famous, Rich 
I don't really talk about my personal life. It's a strange and funny and weird thing. Sometimes you have a conversation with someone and the paparazzi snaps a picture of you and people decide you're dating. If I try to answer everything people say, I would be up all night.|Tracee Ellis Ross|Funny, Life, Night 
In this day and age, I ask anyone I date right away: 'Are you married? Are you in a relationship with anyone? Does anyone think they're in a relationship with you?' And by the way, if someone says, 'Yes, I am dating other people,' that's not necessarily a deal breaker. But you have to communicate it, not hide it.|Tracee Ellis Ross|Relationship, Day, Age 
The best companies in the world have all had predecessors. 'YouTube' was a dating site. You always have to evolve into something else.|Kevin Systrom|Best, World, You 
I'm not great at dating, but I need to do it to relax.|Lena Dunham|Great, Relax, Need 
All my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets and/or people I have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way.|Lena Dunham|Family, Time, Short 
For a long time, I had a crazy girl dating habit.|Eli Roth|Time, Girl, Crazy 
The best dating advice I can give is... are you going in it for marriage, or are you going in it for just a date? You've got to be open about it right away, because the other person could be in it for marriage, but you're not.|Kendra Wilkinson|Marriage, Best, Advice 
I remembered, like, when 'Not When My Daughter' came out, I'm serious, I think dating for Iranian men became a lot harder. Dude's name, Shahrokh - became Tony. Mehsud became Mike.|Maz Jobrani|Daughter, Men, Name 
I'm much more interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and important than who they're dating or what clothes they're wearing or some other asinine, insignificant aspect of their life.|Ben Affleck|Life, Clothes, Important 
I'm not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy.|Vanessa Hudgens|Whole, Very, Experienced 
Dating in college and dating in Hollywood are actually really similar in that the relationships don't last long. Other than that, lots of people in Hollywood tend to be narcissistic, and it's hard to have a relationship with someone like that.|Julia Stiles|Relationship, College 
I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies, because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex, and all the popular kids, and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons, with tape on their glasses. I never saw 'my people' portrayed accurately.|Paul Feig|Cool, People, Glasses 
Dating is kind of hard. Like dinner or something like that. Like a forced awkward situation is very strange. Especially for me, for some reason.|Zac Efron|Me, Strange, Dinner 
My wife and I got engaged in New Hampshire at this lake house that her family's had forever, and it's on Lake Winnipesaukee. And so we went there every summer as we were dating.|Jimmy Fallon|Family, Wife, Summer

Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men. They were about work friendships and relationships, which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about.|Tina Fey|Life, Work, Woman 
Humans have continued to evolve quite a lot over the past ten thousand years, and certainly over 100 thousand. Sure, our biology affects our behavior. But it's unlikely that humans' early evolution is deeply relevant to contemporary psychological questions about dating or the willpower to complete a dissertation.|Annalee Newitz|Past, Behavior, Evolution 
I have no dating life.|Sara Sampaio|Life 
Back when I was dating, the dreaded C word was Commitment. As soon as most men found out I had a child, they ran. If I ever got close enough to say the words, 'I love you,' they ran faster.|Regina Brett|Love, I Love You, Words 
My boyfriend and I are not good at fighting. We're better than we were when we started dating - two breakups and three years ago - but it's never come naturally to either of us. I have often wished we fought like I imagine Pink and Carey Hart fight.|Nikki Glaser|Good, Fight, Pink 
I don't have much experience, but the few times when I would go on a date with a girl - like when I was 12 - there was a lot of sharing, and a lot of talking, and a lot of asking how I am. They thought we were dating, and I was sort of hoping to meet their brothers.|Anderson Cooper|Experience, I Am, Girl 
Women need to know that not all guys are going to hurt them the way that the guy did before they started dating me. I know guys I wouldn't go out with.|Garry Shandling|Women, Hurt, Me 
I'm honest about the journey I've been on, so I definitely don't take dating lightly anymore.|Demi Lovato|Journey, Honest, Anymore 
Women were very, very good at 'Pong'. It was part of the dating scene. The number of people who told me they met their wife or husband playing 'Pong' was huge. They were shoulder to shoulder, talking and playing. It was body contact and verbal contact.|Nolan Bushnell|Women, Good, Wife 
I dated dozens of young men, had fun with all, made commitments to none.|Gene Tierney|Men, Fun, Young 
I'm very open to dating and finding a guy.|Kristin Cavallari|Finding, Open, Guy

As far as dating is concerned, I'm not a casual dating person.|Divyanka Tripathi|Person, Far, Casual 
When I first got started in this whole world of online connecting, we were combating this antiquated stereotype of who used online dating, and we really set out to make it popular with millennials. What I find to be so fascinating now is, I'm seeing an inverse in that trend.|Whitney Wolfe|World, Find, Seeing 
I personally have always hated dating. I was never vulnerable or insecure in any part of my life, but I would become that way with a guy because they have control, according to society, when it comes to dating.|Whitney Wolfe|Life, Society, Control 
Everyone in the dating business wants to know what women want - it's the billion-dollar question. But it's simple: put one in charge, and you find out.|Whitney Wolfe|Business, Women, Simple 
I truly believe that what we're seeing with online dating is very similar to what happened with the Myspace-Facebook era, where Myspace was once this place for online connecting for a very select group of young people. And then Facebook kind of hit at this moment where it was acceptable for everybody to do it.|Whitney Wolfe|Believe, Moment, People 
When I left Tinder, I had no intention of getting back into the dating industry. What I ultimately wanted to do was start this contagious complimentary social network, where kindness was at the helm.|Whitney Wolfe|Kindness, Start, Back 
There's nothing wrong with taking yourself out of the dating pool. You don't need to be in a relationship because that's what society expects of you or because your grandmother thinks you need to be married by a certain date. Those days are over. Instead, take a step back and say, 'I'm OK alone.'|Whitney Wolfe|Relationship, Alone, Society 
When you're setting up your dating profile, choose the photos according to who you are today. A variety of recent shots that are a true representation of your character.|Whitney Wolfe|Today, Character, You 
A bachelor never quite gets over the idea that he is a thing of beauty and a boy forever.|Helen Rowland|Beauty, Boy, Idea 
Up until age 40, most men are just not as mature as women. So, it makes sense that a lot of women date up in age a bit.|Patti Stanger|Age, Women, Men 
I have put gay dating on the map.|Patti Stanger|Gay, Map, Put 
I just thank God my husband and I found each other before the advent of social media. I can't imagine dating someone and seeing what they're doing on their Facebook page. And people breaking up with each other over texts now? We had to break up with each other face to face back then.|Jen Lancaster|God, Social Media, Thank God 
I'm very heterosexual, so dating women is something I'm not ashamed of. But my love life is not as exciting as it is reported to be.|Ranbir Kapoor|Love, Life, Women 
I'm a fabulous date, I make sure I look good, I like hearing what a guy has to say and I make sure the evening is a real laugh. I like to laugh.|Eva Longoria|Good, Laugh, Evening 
You don't need to know who I'm dating. You don't need to know what I'm doing. I'm fine with everybody not knowing that.|Eva Longoria|Not Knowing, Know, You 
I don't know why anyone would want to ask an actor for dating advice. We are not the poster children for healthy relationships.|Ginnifer Goodwin|Children, Advice, Healthy 
I'm so an all-or-nothing person in dating, always. I'm big on not wasting time. And so, yeah, if something's not working, it's time to not hold people back.|Ginnifer Goodwin|Time, People, Working 
What does 'dating' mean? I don't know. I couldn't say.|Catherine Hardwicke|Know, Mean, Say 
I don't like going out on a date unless I know the broad a little bit beforehand. By the way, 'broad' to me is not a detrimental term for women; it's simply another word for female. Anyway, I don't really go out a whole lot, because there aren't many girls I like to take out and spend a whole evening with - at least not an evening in public.|Joe Namath|Women, Me, Know 
Dating is really hard because everyone puts on a front. It's really difficult to see who is who, so it is important to be yourself.|Brooke Burke|Be Yourself, Yourself, See 
The Bachelor'... and 'The Bachelorette'... and 'Bachelor in Paradise'... and the 'After the Final Rose ceremony'. I love a competition dating show.|Erin Foster|Love, Rose, Competition 
I have run from a lot of relationships in favor of being alone. And I tend to find men who use their money and status as a dating tool to be unattractive.|Erin Foster|Money, Alone, Men 
I've never dated anywhere else, so I only know L.A. dating, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. I've pulled back and taken the pressure off of myself to figure it out, because there's so much pressure about status that dating has become this game where you pull out all your tricks.|Erin Foster|Myself, Game, Pressure 
Stuff about me dating Kim Kardashian - I have no idea where that came from and all these other rumors. I don't think I'm that type.|Jeremy Lin|Me, Think, Idea 
Comedy helped me out in my teenage years. It saw me through puberty and helped me to deal with dating.|Rhys Darby|Me, Comedy, Through 
In Indonesia, where I am from, the Dutch-imposed Civil Code dating back to the colonial 1870s prevailed until the 1974 Law on Marriage granted married women greater rights, including the ability to open individual bank accounts.|Sri Mulyani Indrawati|Marriage, Women, Law

A month alone would make me so happy. Not good for my dating prospects.|Barry Jenkins|Happy, Good, Alone 
My husband, after two weeks of dating, asked me, if our relationship were to work out, would I be OK with our first boy being named Ace.|Jennie Finch|Work, Relationship, Me 
I was a late starter on the romantic front. I didn't start dating until I was in my 30s.|Geri Halliwell|Romantic, Start, Late 
I think audiences can relate to the guys I'm playing, those large-and-in-charge idiots. Or maybe I just make them feel better about who they are, or who they're dating.|Rob Riggle|Better, Think, Idiots 
I don't really comment on my personal life because I feel like any comment at all is opening up a whole can of worms. I'd just rather not talk about who I'm dating.|Josh Hartnett|Life, Opening, Personal 
I'm often dating people, but I don't say it because you sort of know it won't last long.|Graham Norton|People, Long, Know 
Kathie Lee and I were working together on our 'Live' morning show when she started dating Frank.

Dodi got a lot of criticism when he began dating Princess Diana. No one seemed to think he was good enough for her.|Lorna Luft|Good, Princess, Think 
I put my family first, and that's why for a long time, you didn't see me dating or hear about me dating or hear about me out. I had other focuses in my life, and that would be my family and my work.|Kimora Lee Simmons|Life, Work, Family 
OKCupid's model is almost entirely based on advertising, which is the way most online media is monetized these days, whether it's the news or whether it's sports, and we think online dating is going to evolve in the exact same way.|Sam Yagan|Sports, Advertising, Media 
I think for marketplace businesses, and when you think about online dating, it's not a social network. It's not a place where you go to talk to people you already know; it's a place you go to interact with someone you've never met before.|Sam Yagan|People, Know, Think

I have no wisdom to share on dating.|Rachel Dratch|Wisdom, Share 
Are you kidding? I'm a terrible cook, but John is a really great one. Literally, I never cook. The whole time we were dating, I prepared two officially romantic meals. Both of them were such disasters that he begs me never to go into the kitchen again.|Rebecca Romijn|Time, Romantic, Great

If you look at Gothic detailing right down to the bottom of a column or the capital of a column, it's a small version of the whole building; that's why, like dating the backbones of a dinosaur, a good historian can look at a detail of a Gothic building and tell you exactly what the rest of the building was, and infer the whole from the parts.|Charles Jencks|Good, Small, Building 
I knew a ton of actors and was friends with them, but I never dated actresses. I tried to date 'normal' people because the Hollywood dating rule is 'one star per couple' because it's quite a challenge to match the egos of two actors.|Zach Galligan|Friends, Challenge, People 
Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that's why I don't have a boyfriend.|Lucy Liu|Funny, Vintage, Why

I think feminism's a bit misinterpreted. It was about casting off all gender roles. There's nothing wrong with a man holding a door open for a girl. But we sort of threw away all the rules, so everybody's confused. And dating becomes a sloppy, uncomfortable, unpleasant thing.|Zosia Mamet|Man, Girl, Door 
I've surfed the Web and the whole dating connection. I find that pretty fascinating, but no real leads.|Taylor Hicks|Real, Find, Connection 
I don't mind dating younger men now.|Jackee Harry|Men, Mind, Now

I wish I was dating one of the ladies in 'Bollywood Hero.' They're gorgeous. Any of them.|Chris Kattan|Hero, Wish, I Wish

That's the dating world. You just keep losing. Everyone does.|Riki Lindhome|Losing, World, You 
My mum wants me to get married - and have children, of course. She's met Gaga; we've been dating a while. We're in a committed relationship, and I'm really happy in my relationship.

It's tough to be 68 and dating. I've given it up now.|Ian McLagan|Tough, Now, Up

It's weird to have people so interested in your personal life. It's a part of the business that grosses me out. I'm always bummed out for people who just happen to be dating a celebrity, and they're also famous, and they can't live their life.|Andy Samberg|Life, Business, Famous 
I feel like I am a real artist and I want to be able to feel what I am singing about. So when I sing, 'Leave (Get Out),' I have been through that. I think it is just a new generation, whether people are ready for it or not. Teenagers are dating.|JoJo|I Am, Artist, People

I can't wait for my little sisters to start dating, because it will really be fun to pick on their boyfriends.|David Gallagher|Fun, Start, Wait 
I really like dating stories, like in Betty and Veronica comics; I like David Lynch and H.P.

Indians mock their corrupt politicians relentlessly, but they regard their honest politicians with silent suspicion.

We live in a digital world where all is available at the touch of a screen. Money has been simplified, changed subtly over time from tangible bills to numbers in cyberspace.

One of the big myths about philanthropy is that it's all about donating funds for a cause. I like to look at it quite differently.

The system that enables the most people to earn the most success is free enterprise, by matching up people's skills, interests, and abilities. In contrast, redistribution simply spreads money around.

The new American dream is one of responsibility. What is the bottom-line number that you're going to be able to pay back toward a student loan responsibly if you're doing it yourself after you have a job?

In Brussels, you are able to have a lot of appointments in a day. In Paris, you can have one, two, maybe three, but you spend all your time on the road, in the car or in the suburbs. In Brussels, everything is easy. It's not a very big city, and the people are very quiet and warm.|Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt|Time, Day, Road 
When you are fitted in a racing car and you race to win, second or third place is not enough.|Ayrton Senna|Win, Racing, You 
A lot of the songs start with an image. I was sitting there playing the guitar and I pictured this old, dirty green car, with the window rolled down, in the hot, hot, hot Texas heat, and this beautiful woman I knew when I was a kid sitting behind the wheel, looking out at me.|Edie Brickell|Beautiful, Beautiful Woman 
I'm not trying to be new school and I'm not old school - I'm classic. There's a lot of new cars and there's a lot of old cars, but I'm just classic in doing what I do.|LL Cool J|School, Trying, Doing 
I love fast cars... and to go too fast in them.|Lara Flynn Boyle|Love, Fast, Go

My first car was a motorcycle.|Adam Carolla|Motorcycle, First 
It's very hard for me to get a new car. It's really hard for me to get a new house. It's really hard for me to move on from the things that give me stability.|Jodie Foster|Me, New Car, House 
Roads get wider and busier and less friendly to pedestrians. And all of the development based around cars, like big sprawling shopping malls. Everything seems to be designed for the benefit of the automobile and not the benefit of the human being.|Bill Bryson|Roads, Shopping, Development 
I think cars encapsulate the history of innovation and style - it's the other side of the coin of the car being public enemy No.1.|Norman Foster|History, Innovation, Style 
Songs don't have to be about going out on Saturday night and having a good rink-up and driving home and crashing cars. A lot of what I've done is about alienation... about where you fit in society.|David Bowie|Home, Good, Society 
If I were to look in the United States or in Europe, in some of the garages, you would have a Bentley or two Bentleys or a high-end Mercedes, and you may find a Smart also in that same garage because that person thinks it's a fun extra car to have. He may have four cars but also have a Smart because he thinks it is cute.|Ratan Tata|Smart, Fun, Cute 
I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the '50s and '60s. The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother's Morris Minor. I drove it around my father's farm. But my favorite car is still a McLaren F1, which I have had for 10 years.|Rowan Atkinson|Father, Mother, Enjoy 
It's annoying when someone's in front of you driving ten miles an hour, and you're like, 'Okay, today,' and someone else is on the side of you, so you can't pass them, and when you finally do pass them and they are texting, the laser cannons just come out and disintegrate that car.|Glenn Danzig|Today, Driving, You 
Flying a good airplane doesn't require near as much attention as a motor car.|Charles Lindbergh|Good, Flying, Airplane 
Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car. You don't have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car. You don't have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh.|Steve Jobs|People, Know, You 
My opinion is it's a bridge too far to go to fully autonomous cars.|Elon Musk|Bridge, Opinion, Far 
Here is a new car, a new iPhone. We buy. We discard. We buy again. In recent years, we've been doing it faster.|Arlie Russell Hochschild|Doing, New Car, New 
I want a car that will last 10 years or longer because I totally hate the process of researching, shopping for a new car, and then haggling for the price. I wish I could just snap my fingers and my car is there.|Kiran Ahluwalia|Hate, Shopping, Want 
Electric cars aren't pollution-free they have to get their energy from somewhere. |Alexandra Paul|Energy, Somewhere 
Success is not two cars or a swimming pool. It's the approval of your peers.|Peter Finch|Success, Swimming, Two 
The newly decorated theatres produced things like car parks and restaurants, so you could have a good night out, quite cheaply without all that bother of having to go somewhere else.|Timothy West|Good, Good Night, Night 
To attract men, I wear a perfume called 'New Car Interior.'|Rita Rudner|Men, New Car, New 
I was quiet, a loner. I was one of those children where, if you put me in a room and gave me some crayons and a pencils, you wouldn't hear from me for nine straight hours. And I was always drawing racing cars and rockets and spaceships and planes, things that were very fast that would take me away.|Gary Oldman|Children, Me, Drawing 
I admit to wasting my life messing around with fast cars and motorcycles.|Brock Yates|Life, My Life, Fast 
I'm starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I've driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there's nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.|Kevin O'Leary|Family, Fun, Long 
I've actually made a prediction that within 30 years a majority of new cars made in the United States will be electric. And I don't mean hybrid, I mean fully electric.|Elon Musk|New, Mean, Within 
Every new car, you open the door, and you look at all those internal mellifluous swoopy bits, and they have no meaning.|Jonathan Ive|Door, Meaning, You 
I know people think we drive around in these nice cars and we do whatever we want and our parents will pay our credit cards, but that's not the case. Sure, my parents were generous; I got a nice car at 16, but at 18 I was cut off. I've worked really hard. I opened the store myself.|Kim Kardashian|Myself, Parents, People 
From solar to electric cars, from geothermal to reconfiguring the grid, the scale of investment needed in green technologies in order to meet whatever agreements on emissions reductions are finally agreed will be immense.|Noreena Hertz|Green, Solar, Investment 
I had a fairly enlightened dad, though if you looked at his resume, it might not seem that way. He was a chartered accountant for Price Waterhouse. He was strict, and we had a very ordered life. To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car.|Hugh Jackman|Life, Day, Father 
Onion rings in the car cushions do not improve with time.|Erma Bombeck|Time, Improve, Onion 
There is a limit to the application of democratic methods. You can inquire of all the passengers as to what type of car they like to ride in, but it is impossible to question them as to whether to apply the brakes when the train is at full speed and accident threatens.|Leon Trotsky|Impossible, Train, Speed 
In Formula One, the car can make a difference in a way that a driver cannot. Whereas Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna spent their early seasons in second-rate machinery, Hamilton walked into the equal best car on the grid. His first season none the less has, by any standards, been extraordinary.|Martin Jacques|Best, Make A Difference 
I'm a hard worker, and everything with me is, if I work hard, I should get paid for it. Everything with me, I try to symbolize something flashy like jewelry or a car. The rubbing hands is a symbol of hustling, so it goes back to the money.|Birdman|Work, Money, Work Hard 
That's the first sign you know you're a Libertarian. You see the red light. You stop. You realize that there's not a car in sight. And you put your foot on the gas.|Gary Johnson|Light, Red, Know 
For me, not owning a car means I may spend a little extra time on public transportation, but I can use that time to read, catch up on work projects, and make the phone calls I couldn't get to earlier. Plus, I never waste time at the mechanics or gas station.|Lynn Jurich|Work, Time, Me 
In August of 2002, I survived a car accident. Although I can still see the van speeding toward us, I cannot bring to mind the crash itself - only its aftermath.|Siri Hustvedt|Mind, I Can, See 
One person's car is another person's scenery.|Jonathan Ive|Scenery, Person, Another 
We want to get to the point that using Uber is cheaper than owning a car.|Travis Kalanick|Want, Point, Uber 
The older Mercedes is absolutely beautiful. It's got that lovely purring feeling as the engine ticks over, which you just don't get in a modern car.|Sarah Alexander|Beautiful, You, Lovely 
At a European auto show, I had someone from a German car company come up to me and say the Karma should cost $125,000, not $87,900, but our development process lets us lower the costs. I guarantee it's profitable.|Henrik Fisker|Karma, Me, Company 
When you get into a car, and there's trash, or it's dirty, or one of the hubcaps is off, you're like, 'Come on, dude.' Every woman likes the confidence and self-respect that says, 'I get oil changes. I look after my vehicle.' That's what I recommend: Act like you don't care, but take care of your body.|T. J. Miller|Confidence, Woman, Changes 
I love vintage cars because you can do so much more to them.|T-Pain|Love, Vintage, You 
I play the harmonica. The only way I can play is if I get my car going really fast, and stick it out the window.|Steven Wright|Window, Fast, Play 
The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?|James Hillman|Children, Home, Culture 
I like to smile a lot before going in the car. I make jokes, even on the grid, and then I can still manage to focus when it counts.|Romain Grosjean|Smile, Focus, I Can 
I had a friend who was a clown. When he died, all his friends went to the funeral in one car.|Steven Wright|Friends, Friend, Clown 
We could definitely make a flying car - but that's not the hard part. The hard part is, how do you make a flying car that's super safe and quiet? Because if it's a howler, you're going to make people very unhappy.|Elon Musk|Flying, People, You 
We're in a giant car heading towards a brick wall and everyone's arguing over where they're going to sit.|David Suzuki|Brick, Arguing, Everyone 
We're going to test with the same car, but we have a new car ready.|Larry Dixon|New Car, Test, New

It's a massive motor in a tiny, lightweight car.|Carroll Shelby|Motor, Massive, Lightweight 
Electric cars are coal-powered cars. Their carbon emissions can be worse than gasoline-powered cars.|Vinod Khosla|Electric Cars, Carbon, Worse 
A car is like a mother-in-law - if you let it, it will rule your life.|Jaime Lerner|Life, Mother-In-Law, You 
'Mosaic' is about what we see and what we don't see. I learned how people can develop other senses to compensate for a missing one when I was a child. My best friend, Carol, who is profoundly deaf, saved me from an approaching car that she 'heard' when I didn't.|Gayle Lynds|Best, Best Friend, Child 
Parisians overwhelmingly buy small cars. And it's not because people are petite, but because fuel is drop-dead expensive. Gasoline costs more than twice as much in Paris as in New York.|Serge Schmemann|Small, New York, People 
I hooked up my accelerator pedal in my car to my brake lights. I hit the gas, people behind me stop, and I'm gone.|Steven Wright|Me, People, Stop 
I replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights, so it looks like I'm the only one moving.|Steven Wright|Moving, Looks, Like 
In the last three years of racing I've met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it's the same thing. My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn't have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.|Tim Allen|Women, Best, Wife 
I would have probably stolen cars - it would have given me the same adrenaline rush as racing.|Valentino Rossi|Racing, Me, Same 
I always do like seeing other people dance in their cars. It's one of the things that makes me happy.|Ariel Gore|Happy, Dance, Me 
I only know it takes weeks to recover, as if one had been in a car accident.|Patricia Highsmith|Know, Car Accident, Accident 
I dated a guy and he liked me but I didn't like him. I went through his wardrobe and cleaned out his house and got him to get a new car. He said to me, 'If I give you $10,000, will you find me my wife because I want someone like you?' And within a year, he got married. That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.|Patti Stanger|Job, Wife, Me 
Racism has been for everyone like a horrible, tragic car crash, and we've all been heavily sedated from it. If we don't come into consciousness of this tragedy, there's going to be a violent awakening we don't want. The question is, can we wake up?|Anna Deavere Smith|Racism, Wake Up, Tragedy 
Bad debt is debt that makes you poorer. I count the mortgage on my home as bad debt, because I'm the one paying on it. Other forms of bad debt are car payments, credit card balances, or other consumer loans.|Robert Kiyosaki|Home, Credit, You 
The Rolls Royce was the real first car. It wasn't the first new car I got, but it was the first real car I bought that's like, 'Wow, I got this.'|Meek Mill|New Car, Real, New 
I remember having my father stand over me when I had driven over my own foot; one leg was out of the car and one leg was in the car. He looked at me and told me that I was a drunk and that he was ashamed to call me his son. That night, I stopped drinking and I never drank again; I was twenty four.|Randy Bachman|Father, Son, Night 
If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.|Earl Wilson|Think, You, Try

I'm not a bad driver. And I never will be because I took lessons when I was quite a boy. I never had to pass a test because there wasn't such a thing when I first started driving a motor car. So I didn't have to pass one.|Richard Murdoch|Driving, Boy, Test 
As soon as I get my car I think I'll be going to the cinema more. Since I don't go very often, there are no films that are a must see at the moment. I usually wait till they come out on DVD.|Tom Felton|Moment, Think, See 
The city needs a car like a fish needs a bicycle.|Dean Kamen|City, Fish, Bicycle 
I know a man who doesn't pay to have his trash taken out. How does he get rid of his trash? He gift wraps it, and puts in into an unlocked car.|Henny Youngman|Man, Gift, Know 
I've always had an affinity and a passion for cars and that whole car culture.|Ludacris|Culture, Passion, Always

Detroit: Cars and rock 'n' roll. Not a bad combo.|Kid Rock|Rock, Bad, Roll 
You know what I really love? The CD players in a car. How when you put the CD right up by the slot, it actually takes it out of your hand, like it's hungry. It pulls it in, and you feel like it wants more silver discs.|Tom Waits|Love, Know, You 
A woman is gentle, soft, delicate, and a man's position is to protect her, help her up stairs, make sure she's in the car safely first. Take good care of your woman, and the sky's the limit!|Taraji P. Henson|Good, Man, Sky 
Driving will never be away from me - I can't just give it up. It's all I've ever done, and there's something about being in that car.|Jimmie Johnson|Me, Driving, Done 
Short stories, for me, it's like you step inside this brand new car and you drive it and you drive it into a tree and you walk away from it.|Kevin Wilson|Tree, Short, Walk 
I am quite a relaxed person out of the car, but in the car I am aggressive, I never give up, I fight to the end and I try 100% all the time.|Heikki Kovalainen|Time, Never Give Up, I Am 
Traffic in the streets of Bombay is chaotic at best. Riding a bicycle is a dangerous occupation. However, there are hundreds of them on the streets competing with the cars and buses and lorries because it is the poor man's mode of transport.|Rohinton Mistry|Best, Man, Bicycle 
Why are video games so violent? The ones I've seen remind me of the 4th of July, with everything exploding, buildings, cars, airplanes, men and women. Kill, kill, and kill for sport and entertainment.|Madeleine M. Kunin|Women, Men, Video Games 
Rappers aren't the really rich ones. We all have nice houses with studios and cars, but you need a piece of someone's business to be super wealthy.|Drake|Business, Rich, Nice 
You can take lessons to become almost anything: flying lessons, piano lessons, skydiving lessons, acting lessons, race car driving lessons, singing lessons. But there's no class for comedy. You have to be born with it. God has to give you this gift.|Steve Harvey|God, Gift, Singing 
My choices, including those related to the day-to-day aspects of life, like the use of a modest car, are related to a spiritual discernment that responds to a need that arises from looking at things, at people and from reading the signs of the times. Discernment in the Lord guides me in my way of governing.|Pope Francis|Life, Spiritual, Reading 
People ask for this life, but they don't really understand what comes with it. People just see the outside and that looks good - big houses, cars, girls, but you never see how the person is feeling deep down inside. Me personally, being a man, I'm going to feel better displaying all of this and pouring my heart out on each record.|Bow Wow|Life, Good, Deep 
Justice is expensive in America. There are no Free Passes... You might want to remember this, the next time you get careless and blow off a few Parking Tickets. They will come back to haunt you the next time you see a Cop car in your rear-view mirror.|Hunter S. Thompson|Time, Justice, America 
In theory, cars are fairly simple. If they don't start, it's either the fuel system or the electrical system. Teach yourself about the path of each in your engine and tracing it is fairly straightforward. But at the beginning, mastering each new system seems like an unreachable shore. The car is effectively a black box.|Adam Savage|Path, Simple, Yourself 
I love to personalize things. I love to make things my own. I like to name everything - from cars to iPhones to the socks I just lost.|Rachel Nichols|Love, Lost, Name 
My mother's sister was killed in a trolley car accident, so I was raised as one of eight with my sister and six male cousins.|Alan King|Sister, Mother, Cousins 
The Internet has made some phenomenal breakthroughs that are still only poorly understood in terms of changing people's ideas of us and them. If mass media, social isolation in the suburbs, alienating workplaces and long car commutes create a bunker mentality, the Internet does the opposite.|Alex Steffen|Ideas, Media, Internet 
You can't stop everything from happening. But we've gotten to a point where we're certainly trying. If a car doesn't have four hundred air bags in it, then it's no good.|Clint Eastwood|Good, Trying, You 
If you think about computing, there isn't just one way to compute, just like there's not just one way to move around. You can have shoes, you can have a car, you can have a bicycle, submarine, rocket, plane, train, glider, whatever. Because you have one doesn't mean you get rid of another one... But PCs continue to be important.|Michael Dell|Shoes, Train, Bicycle 
I'm just disillusioned with the hip-hop sound right now. It's too materialistic. You know, I'm the kind of guy ... I can't do that. If you track my movement, you'll never see a picture of me with any girl that wasn't mine, or my own car. My jewelry, my clothes. What kind of gangsta rapper has a stylist? A stylist?!|Ice T|Girl, Jewelry, Me 
When billionaire car dealers or manufacturers pay for ambassadorships, at least they pay with money earned by selling something of value.|Elizabeth Warren|Money, Value, Selling 
Have you read 'The Grapes of Wrath?' That was my family. My dad was a sharecropper in western Oklahoma. When the dust storms came and everything got wiped out, they came to California. The guys with the mattresses on the tops of their cars in the movie? That was the way it was.|B. Wayne Hughes|Family, You, Dust 
I noticed the people who drove the nicest cars were all in the garment business.|Do Won Chang|Business, People, Noticed 
I've always worked on my own home and different places that I've owned. I really enjoyed it. But I'm a mechanic, a motorcycle and car builder.|Antonio Sabato, Jr.|Home, Motorcycle, Mechanic 
I don't buy cars I can't drive.|Wayne Huizenga|Drive, Buy 
Most of us have to spend a lot of energy to learn how to drive a car. Then we have to spend the rest of our lives over-concentrating as we drive and text and eat a burrito and put on makeup. As a result, 30,000 people die every year in a car accident in the U.S.|Astro Teller|Makeup, Energy, People 
When I turned 16, my dad made me sign a contract - he made us sign contracts for everything - that if I hit my car, I would be responsible for paying for it. I was in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I tapped someone. It was so not a big deal, but I had to pay for it.|Kim Kardashian|Me, Traffic, Responsible 
I have a nice car, a Mercedes. And then I have an old El Camino truck that I'm crazy about. I like to get in that truck and go up in the hills near where I live, in Vegas, and take my camera. That, to me, is Heaven, being out in nature, taking pictures of the wildlife.|B. B. King|Nature, Crazy, Me 
CGI has fully ruined car crashes. Because how can you be impressed with them now? When you watch them in the '70s, it was real cars, real metal, real blasts. They're really doing it and risking their lives. But I knew CGI was gonna start taking over.|Quentin Tarantino|Start, Doing, You 
If you're one car accident away from poverty, you're on a high wire without a safety net. And that's a challenging proposition.|Thomas Perez|Safety, Poverty, You 
Stationary storage will be as big as the car business long term. The growth rate will probably be several times what it is for the car business.|Elon Musk|Business, Growth, Long 
Latency is very important when you think about autonomous cars and things like that - 5G will really change the game, and I think will be another spike of growth in the wireless industry.|Lowell McAdam|Change, Growth, Game 
I grew up on the back of a motorcycle - my dad didn't have a car until I was a teenager.|Aisha Tyler|Motorcycle, Up, Back 
Anyone who has ever been privileged to direct a film also knows that, although it can be like trying to write 'War and Peace' in a bumper car in an amusement park, when you finally get it right, there are not many joys in life that can equal the feeling.|Stanley Kubrick|Life, Peace, War 
Why shouldn't a car key look like a car?|Franz von Holzhausen|Key, Look, Why 
I've got a great team of engineers behind this race car. I've got a great bunch of mechanics that make it reliable. This car is developed to go out there and be better than the Reynard, and I feel that it is.|Al Unser|Team, Great, Better 
Should we have background checks, waiting periods? To drive a car you have to pass a test that shows you know how to drive your car safely, you should have to do the same thing with guns.|Michael D. Barnes|Waiting, Know, Guns 
I was a workaholic. I never stopped. I lived in fifth gear. I bought cars. I invested in stocks. I made more money than I had ever imagined.|Mitch Albom|Money, Never, Workaholic 
In my iPod, there are many operas, from A to Z. I have 'Aida' and 'Boheme' and 'Butterfly' and 'Cavalleria'. My passion is for opera, but when I'm in the car, I listen to everything.|Andrea Bocelli|Passion, Butterfly, Listen 
You have to maintain the balance between fast growth and smooth growth. It's like driving a car and knowing when to balance the gas pedal and the brake.|Guo Guangchang|Growth, Balance, You

In this industry, you have to have passion. It's tough; there's no mercy. But I just love cars - I love to bring a new car to market. And every time I do this, it gets a little easier.|Henrik Fisker|Love, Time, Passion 
My favorite part of any playdate comes later when I get to carry my exhausted and sleeping daughter to the car. Is there anything more trusting than a sleeping child completely and utterly leaning into your body?|Nia Vardalos|Daughter, Child, Body 
I see a future where American companies lead the world in the production of hybrid-plug in cars and electric vehicles.|Bernie Sanders|Future, American, World 
My dad took me out to see a meteor shower when I was a little kid, and it was scary for me because he woke me up in the middle of the night. My heart was beating; I didn't know what he wanted to do. He wouldn't tell me, and he put me in the car and we went off, and I saw all these people lying on blankets, looking up at the sky.|Steven Spielberg|Heart, Sky, Night 
A car is only trouble at a certain point.|Ryan Gosling|Trouble, Point, Only 
This is going to sound ridiculous, but I remember watching 'Boyz n the Hood,' and there is a scene where Cuba Gooding, Jr. gets pressed against a car by a police officer, and he starts crying because it's so humiliating. I remember thinking in that moment that I could totally identify with him, and I'm a little white kid from Canada.|Ryan Gosling|Thinking, Moment, Remember 
On a bike, being just slightly above pedestrian and car eye level, one gets a perfect view of the goings-on in one's own town.|David Byrne|Eye, Bike, View 
I'm very fond of Tennessee Williams' plays, and when my husband and I went to New Orleans in the late 1970s, we saw 'A Street Car Named Desire.'|Ruth Rendell|Husband, Late, Desire 
For me, personally, skiing holds everything. I used to race cars, but skiing is a step beyond that. It removes the machinery and puts you one step closer to the elements. And it's a complete physical expression of freedom.|Robert Redford|Freedom, Step, Me 
The fact is I like Mumbai less and less. My son says, 'Baba, let's go for a drive', and I tell him, 'Where's the fun of a drive in this place?' You get caught in a million traffic jams, and you spend time cooped in your car with all that mad cacophony around you.|Om Puri|Time, Son, Fun 
I went to Zimbabwe. I know how white people feel in America now relaxed! Cause when I heard the police car I knew they weren't coming after me! |Richard Pryor|America, Me, People 
Yeah, well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track, just crush it. So if you like fast cars, you'll love this car. And then oh, by the way, it happens to be electric and it's twice the efficiency of a Prius.|Elon Musk|Love, Efficiency, Think 
My first car was a BMW. A white BMW.|Jamie-Lynn Sigler|White, First, BMW 
We should tell our kids to just have fun, participate and not get bent on winning or losing.

The bass player's function, along with the drums, is to be the engine that drives the car... everything else is merely colours.|Suzi Quatro|Everything, Bass, Drums 
A perfect day would be to get into the car, drive out to Yosemite and go camping.|Michael Steger|Day, Perfect, Camping 
Pilots have their names painted just beneath the canopy of their aircraft. This gives the pilot a sense of ownership for his or her jet. What's more, like cars, each aircraft has its own personality, so it's important for a pilot to get to know and love his aircraft.|Simon Sinek|Love, Personality, Know 
Self-driving cars are the natural extension of active safety and obviously something we should do.|Elon Musk|Safety, Something, Natural 
Electric cars are going to be very important for urban transportation.|Carlos Ghosn|Important, Transportation 
My favorite affirmation when I feel stuck or out of sorts is: Whatever I need is already here, and it is all for my highest good. Jot this down and post it conspicuously throughout your home, on the dashboard of your car, at your office, on your microwave oven, and even in front of your toilets!|Wayne Dyer|Home, Good, Favorite 
The subway in New York is a great social experiment there are so many races and ways of life sitting together on each car. |Jon Batiste|Life, Great, Together 
You can't develop a great car and sell it as an independent. You can develop a great car and make a deal with Mercedes.|Eric Fellner|Great, Independent, You 
What a piece of garbage this smart car is. There's a commercial - the smart car has zero percent interest for six years. Well, good, I got zero percent in six years in buying this smart car. I'll tell you that much. I mean, it's ridiculous. My buddy has a smart car, totaled it. He hit a deer tick.|Larry the Cable Guy|Good, Smart, You 
I think that just sitting down and having casual conversation is the hardest stuff to do. But the extremes? I know what it feels like to come racing around the corner at 90 miles an hour, sliding the car sideways. I know what gear I'm hitting it in when I'm coming around the corner and where I need to downshift. So to me, that's the fun stuff.|Paul Walker|Fun, Me, Conversation 
Whither goest thou, America, in thy shiny car in the night?|Jack Kerouac|America, Night, Thou 
My husband is pretty particular about his cars. In his opinion, the Mercedes are the best of the best.|Lauren Lee Smith|Best, Husband, Opinion 
We don't sell a car, we sell a dream. We are Italy's national team. There are many great soccer teams in our country, but there is only one Ferrari.|Luca Cordero di Montezemolo|Team, Great, Soccer 
I love getting on the subway because you get on the car, and you see the entire human race represented in any given subway car.|Tim Daly|Love, You, See

If you own a home with wheels on it and several cars without, you just might be a redneck.|Jeff Foxworthy|Home, You, Redneck

I was 16 years old, driving to LA, and sleeping in my car, just trying to make it happen.|Nick Cannon|Make It Happen, Driving 
Driving with one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake is likely to get you nowhere, but certainly will burn out vital parts of your car. Similarly, cutting taxes on the middle class, but increasing them on the 'rich' is likely to result in an economic burnout.|Terry Savage|Driving, Rich, You 
My mother was determined to make us independent. When I was four years old, she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields. I got hopelessly lost.|Richard Branson|Home, Mother, Me 
Relationships, like cars, should undergo regular services to make sure they are still roadworthy.|Zygmunt Bauman|Relationships, Like, Still

When you're in your 20s, you're a little more carefree; you're single. You have a very different way of looking at the world and experiencing the world. But later in your 30s, when you have children, a career, career obstacles, mortgages, car payments and relationships, you have to negotiate; that's a very different life.|Melissa De Sousa|Life, Children, World 
One time, I was posing on a car for a calendar shoot. I was doused with oil and literally slid off the car, bikini, heels and all!|Candace Kita|Time, Oil, Posing 
First time I looked at a Formula One car in person, I just stared at the cockpit, figuring I'd never get in there. The drivers wear the whole car like a tight-fitting suit.|Chris Hemsworth|Time, First Time, Person 
Part of my problem is that I cannot dispel the myths that have somehow accumulated over the years. Somebody writes something, it's completely off the wall, but it gets filed and repeated until everyone believes it. For instance, I've read that I wear a football helmet in the car.|Stanley Kubrick|Football, Problem, Years 
I have bad reflexes. I was once run over by a car being pushed by two guys.|Woody Allen|Run, Bad, Two 
The world is full of abundance and opportunity, but far too many people come to the fountain of life with a sieve instead of a tank car... a teaspoon instead of a steam shovel. They expect little and as a result they get little.|Ben Sweetland|Life, Opportunity, World 
We must move away from our dependency on fossil fuels, and I am glad that GM has invested over $1 billion in hydrogen fuel cells cars to meet this goal.|Albert Wynn|Environmental, I Am, Goal 
At a car dealership, the person who sells the car is the hero, and also gets the commission. But if the mechanics don't service that car well, the customer won't return.|Roger Staubach|Hero, Service, Customer 
How many times have you been on the freeway and had someone fly by you at 100 mph then end up two cars ahead of you at the off ramp? What's the point?|Mark Harmon|End, Fly, You 
I'm addicted to laughing. I go to see a lot of comedy shows. I'm addicted to playing really loud and obnoxious rock music in my car. I'm addicted to beautiful clothes and shoes. I just love gorgeous stuff and work hard to acquire pretty things, shiny things. I'm addicted to shiny things!|Nadia Giosia|Love, Work, Music 
'Blind Curve,' the book I'm working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour. I was pulled out of my car for a minor traffic violation - an incident that escalated into my being thrown into cuffs and told I was going to jail. Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.|Andrew Gross|Hero, Book, Crazy 
Part of us believes the new car is better because it lasts longer. But, in fact, that's the worst thing about the new car. It will stay around to disappoint you, whereas a trip to Europe is over. It evaporates. It has the good sense to go away, and you are left with nothing but a wonderful memory.|Daniel Gilbert|Good, Memory, Better 
I don't think I'm a good ol' boy. Honestly, the last thing I am is a redneck. I like silk sheets, fancy cars, beautiful women, good whiskey.|Joe Jamail|Beautiful, Women, Good 
I was homeless for almost a year and a half, just living in my car or bouncing around peoples' houses, going to 7-Eleven at the end of the day and asking them for the taquitos that they were going to throw out because I hadn't eaten in two days.|Andy Biersack|Day, Homeless, End 
A broad margin of leisure is as beautiful in a man's life as in a book. Haste makes waste, no less in life than in housekeeping. Keep the time, observe the hours of the universe, not of the cars.|Henry David Thoreau|Life, Time, Beautiful 
By the end of the 1950s, American cars were so reliable that their reliability went without saying even in car ads. Thousands of them bear testimony to this today, still running on the roads of Cuba though fueled with nationalized Venezuelan gasoline and maintained with spit and haywire.|P. J. O'Rourke|Today, American, End 
In Copenhagen, there's a long-term commitment to creating a well-functioning pedestrian city where all forms of movement - pedestrian, bicycles, cars, public transportation - are accommodated with equal priority.|Bjarke Ingels|City, Commitment, Creating 
I try to get away from the pits as quickly as I can. I speak to my engineer when I get out of the car, usually there's some press to do, then I will go off and have a shower and get my dry, clean overalls and clothing on. I'll have a massage, stretch and something to eat. I don't sleep, but I try to close my eyes for a while.|Allan McNish|Eyes, Sleep, Speak 
Americans are the only people in the world known to me whose status anxiety prompts them to advertise their college and university affiliations in the rear window of their automobiles.|Paul Fussell|College, World, Anxiety 
I don't run a car, have never run a car. I could say that this is because I have this extremely tender environmentalist conscience, but the fact is I hate driving.|David Attenborough|Hate, Driving, Conscience 
I don't like new cars I'm into vintage cars - there's a Jaguar E-Type in the 'Goldie' video. |ASAP Rocky|Vintage, New, Like

Long after the bomb falls and you and your good deeds are gone, cockroaches will still be here, prowling the streets like armored cars.|Tama Janowitz|Good, Long, You

I remember being at Greenblatt's on Sunset, and some guy just walked straight up to me, and he had some bling on and whatever, and said something about a party down in Malibu and asked if I would jump in his car and go to the party. All I could think was, 'Who are you? I don't know you, and I don't care about how good your car is.'|Yvonne Strahovski|Good, Sunset, Me 
Winter in the country is very white. There is black grit on all the shoulders of the roads and on the big mounds from the plows, and all the cars are filthy, but the fields are dazzling and untouched and pristine.|Susan Orlean|Winter, Roads, Black 
Tailor Made will help Ferrari's clients tailor their cars in a very personal, specific way. It's a bespoke service, like visiting Huntsman or Anderson & Sheppard or whoever your favourite Savile Row tailor is.|Lapo Elkann|Service, Help, Clients 
I like Mercedes because my wife has been in two big accidents and emerged without a scratch, thanks to the safety of these cars.|Nobu Matsuhisa|Safety, Wife, Thanks

We were racing at circuits where there were no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous.|Jackie Stewart|Time, Racing, Lying

My first car was a 1976 Toyota Corolla Liftback in red, like the one in 'The Blues Brothers.' I painted a Union Jack on the roof. I was absolutely in love with it until I destroyed it, which broke my heart!|Richard Hammond|Love, Heart, Red 
Okay, let's talk about cartoon labels for half a second - some people think anything with a dog or a car or a colorful alien is garbage, which is not true. Look at Big Moose Red. It's, like, a $6 wine with a cheesy label, and it's actually a solid wine.|Gary Vaynerchuk|Dog, Wine, Red 
My first car was an '84 Ford Taurus. It caught on fire from me trying to change the fuel pump, so that wasn't good at all. Dried leaves on the ground while I was trying to change the fuel pump. Don't do that. Do it on concrete.|T-Pain|Change, Good, Fire 
I hate the technological rip-offs that pass for music formats these days, and go back to vinyl to hear a good record because the sound is always so much fuller. I don't even like listening to music in the car.|John Lydon|Music, Good, Hate 
In an automobile, if you think about the navigation system - of all the cars in the world, four out of five cars in the world if they have a navigation system have something from Nokia inside that car - the data, the platform, something. So we play a very strong role there.|Stephen Elop|Strong, World, Data 
The first thing I ever rode when I was a kid was a motorcycle, so I knew how to drive a motorcycle before a car.|John Travolta|Motorcycle, Drive, First

The reason I moved to California the first time was to build the Cobra. I thought it was stupid to have a 1918 taxicab engine in what Europeans like to call a performance car when a little American V-8 could do the job better.|Carroll Shelby|Time, Job, American 
I drive the same car that I've driven since I was 16. That's who I am.|Selena Gomez|I Am, Drive, Same 
I don't even possess a car. I ride in auto-rickshaws because I like to be a part of the masses. I don't want to single myself out as someone up and above.|Shakuntala Devi|Myself, Ride, Want 
When I was a kid in Nebraska, a cantankerous farmer, known for plinking with his '22 at passing cars in which he perceived enemies, ingeniously rigged up a shotgun in his house, trained on the inside of his front door so as to widely distribute any intruder.|Dick Cavett|Door, Farmer, House 
My friend is a former race car driver, so he races for Mercedes, and I root for him. I have a car that I love to race, I'll take it to the track.|Hill Harper|Love, Friend, Race 
We loved cars until the '70s or so. Then they became appliances. They turned into motorized cup holders. Most of it has to do with urban sprawl. What began as pleasure ends up in necessity, as so many things do.|P. J. O'Rourke|Loved, Pleasure, Cup 
Even we schoolchildren know that ordinary diplomats don't drive around in unmarked cars carrying Glock pistols.|Malala Yousafzai|Drive, Know, Ordinary 
I thought boxes were the best toy. When my parents got a new car, I ran to my mother and said, 'Did it come in a box?'|Colin Angle|Best, Mother, Parents 
When I was 10, I was hit by a car, which turned my right tibia into a jigsaw puzzle.|John Scalzi|Puzzle, Right, Which 
If you think about jeans or phones or television, we are used to new brands popping up right and left. But in the car industry, we grew up with Mercedes, BMW, General Motors, and Ford, and nobody can remember during his or her upbringing a new car brand coming to life.|Henrik Fisker|Life, Television, Remember 
One can find a squalid America as easily as a scenic America; a bitter, hopeless America as easily as the confident America of polyethylene wrapping, new cars, and camping trips in the summer.|Robert Kennedy|America, Summer, Camping 
There definitely will be flying cars, but whether there'll be flying cars for most people to use, it'll probably take a long time to straighten everything out, all the rules and hassles. It'll take a while to figure out how to keep people from crashing into each other.|Zack Greinke|Time, Rules, People 
I was raised in Chicago and I guess that was one of the special breeding grounds for gangsters of all colors. That was the Detroit of the gangster world. The car industry was thugs.|Quincy Jones|Colors, World, Gangster 
For me, being in a car or on an airplane is like being in limbo. It's this dead zone between two places. But to walk, you're some place that's already interesting. You're not just between places. Things are happening.|Rebecca Solnit|Walk, Me, Airplane 
There's an unseen force which lets birds know when you've just washed your car.|Denis Norden|Birds, Know, You 
I think the true test of a pop song, for me, and I've talked to a lot of other writers about this, is you take your demo, you pop it in your car and you drive down Sunset Blvd. to Santa Monica, and that's the Hollywood car test.|Ryan Tedder|Sunset, Song, Me 
I don't listen to the radio, cause I don't have a driver's license. But if I'm in L.A. or somewhere where we have to rent a car, I'll hear my songs. Sometimes I hear them when I'm in stores, and I'm still like a little kid in a candy shop: 'Oh my God, that's my song!' I don't know how that could ever get old.|Benny Blanco|God, Song, Candy 
Car designers are just going to have to come up with an automobile that outlasts the payments.|Erma Bombeck|Automobile, Up, Going 
You're safer in the race car than you are in cars going to and from the track.|Mario Andretti|You, Race, Going

Consider what kind of car you get. Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.|Al Gore|Impact, You, Products

I was brought up in a car family, my dad loved cars and I was taught the art of making an Austin 7 operate.|Nick Mason|Family, Art, Austin 
I liken myself to Henry Ford and the auto industry, I give you 90 percent of what most people need.|Adam Osborne|Myself, People, You 
Driving race cars was an avenue for me to learn how to build my own car, and that was my ambition all along.|Carroll Shelby|Ambition, Me, Learn

Tesla is here to stay and keep fighting for the electric car revolution.|Elon Musk|Revolution, Fighting, Here

If you don't drink, smoke, or drive a car, you're a tax evader.|Thomas S. Foley|Tax, Drive, You 
Going to church doesn't make you any more a Christian than going to the garage makes you a car.|Laurence J. Peter|Christian, Church, You

The lead car is unique, except for the one behind it which is identical.|Murray Walker|Unique, Behind, Lead

I am really looking forward to driving another of my father's car at the show in Rotterdam.|Nelson Piquet|Father, I Am

In 1950, when the Giants signed me, they gave me $15,000. I bought a 1950 Mercury. I couldn't drive, but I had it in the parking lot there, and everybody that could drive would drive the car. So it was like a community thing.|Willie Mays|Community, Me, Drive 
Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating the mind is like a car battery - it recharges by running. |Bill Watterson|Thought, Mind, Process 
My brother was a lifeguard in a car wash.|Henny Youngman|Brother, Lifeguard, Wash

People would say you look weak if you're not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car while always wearing a tie. Above all, to be 'strong' you're always supposed to be giving orders.|George Papandreou|Strong, Giving, Be Strong 
If you don't have the story and the unfolding of the trajectory of the saga, it's like getting in a car and not having any gas.|Gus Van Sant|Story, You, Gas 
I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie: blood, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery. The children of God are running amok, wayward. Maybe that's why they're so relatable.|Bono|Children, God, Action 
The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh, I was proud.|Bob Uecker|Son, Parents, Me 
Sometimes I wish I could drive a car, but I'm gonna drive a car one day, so I don't worry about that.|Stevie Wonder|Day, Worry, Wish

Every day I get to 'Think' and work on everything from digitizing electric grids so they can accommodate renewable energy and enable mass adoption of electric cars, helping major cities reduce congestion and pollution, to developing new micro-finance programs that help tiny businesses get started in markets such as Brazil, India, Africa.|Ginni Rometty|Work, Day, Help

I used to have this Mercedes, a dark blue 450SLC, which was the most beautiful car. I'd like to have another unusual, beautiful car.|Andrew Davies|Beautiful, Blue, Dark 
Devices are getting smarter - your television, your car - and that means more data spread around. There needs to be a fabric that connects all these devices. That's what we do.|Drew Houston|Data, Television, Smarter 
I did plenty of jobs that I hated. I was a bank teller and terrible at it. I parked cars, a valet. I answered phones. I somehow avoided being a waiter. I knew I wouldn't be able to keep the order straight. I'm not much of a multi-tasker.|Will Ferrell|Phones, Bank, Straight 
I rolled the second car that I ever owned, a Toyota 4 Runner. This was winter in Colorado, two weeks before the 2002 Olympic trials. I was driving in the outside lane, and my rear tire caught some black ice, and we totally turned sideways to the point where we were heading right toward the median.|Apolo Ohno|Winter, Driving, Black 
No matter how good a driver you are, you have to have the right car and the right team behind you in order to succeed.|Nico Rosberg|Good, Team, You 
If mass media, social isolation in the suburbs, alienating workplaces and long car commutes create a bunker mentality, the Internet does the opposite.|Alex Steffen|Media, Internet, Isolation 
When you drive your car, E = mc2 is at work. As the engine burns gasoline to produce energy in the form of motion, it does so by converting some of the gasoline's mass into energy, in accord with Einstein's formula.|Brian Greene|Work, Energy, You 
Trying to run Congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil. Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up?|Jonathan Haidt|Trying, Relationships, Oil 
I never bothered with cars. I was probably one of the few kids in school who didn't run around with hot-rod magazines. As I would be at home fiddling with my guitar, they would be fiddling with a car engine.|Angus Young|Home, School, Guitar 
I always try to say, 'If you want to help the environment, try to do just two things. One, use less of your car. Second, separate your garbage.'|Jaime Lerner|Help, Environment, Want 
In the early nineties, I was a cub reporter on a city newspaper in Limerick, and assigned to the courthouse there. One day, an old detective sergeant came and whispered to me in the press pit. He pointed out a young offender, a teenager who was up for stealing a car or something relatively minor, and said, 'See this kid? He'll kill.'|Kevin Barry|Day, City, Me 
I hate to take compromises with a racing car. The more standard a car is, the more compromises you have to take.|Michael Schumacher|Hate, Racing, You

I drive an American car. It's a Chrysler. That's not an endorsement. It's more like a cry for pity.|Michael Moore|American, Drive, Cry 
We're very good in America at talking about stuff, often stuff to buy. We tend to talk about our iPods. We tend to talk about cars or new fads.|Milton Glaser|Good, America, New 
Marketers use big data profiling to predict who is about to get pregnant, who is likely to buy a new car, and who is about to change sexual orientations. That's how they know what ads to send to whom. The NSA, meanwhile, wants to know who is likely to commit an act of terrorism - and for this, they need us.|Douglas Rushkoff|Change, Data, Know 
I am really interested in eccentric minds. It's rather like being fascinated by how cars work. It's really boring if your car works all the time. But as soon as something happens, you get the bonnet up. If someone has an abnormal or dysfunctional state of mind, you get the bonnet up.|Mark Haddon|Work, Time, I Am 
I've loved car racing all my life. I watch NASCAR regularly, and drag racing because we have Raceway Park in New Jersey. I think I got it from my father.|Queen Latifah|Life, Father, My Life 
I get labelled as just being about one thing, but there's lots of layers to what I do. It's just lazy journalism, but people start to accept it. If people spent an hour in my car driving around London and listening to the stuff I listen to, they'd hear some interesting stuff.|Paul Weller|Listening, Journalism 
My first car was, as depicted in 'Sleepwalk with Me,' my mother's '92 Volvo station wagon that had 80,000 miles on it, and I had put 40,000 miles on it, so by the time it retired it had 120,000, and I basically killed it. It served me well, and my mechanic was always very angry with me because I just didn't properly care for it.|Mike Birbiglia|Time, Mother, Me 
I've always listened to a lot of rap. It's all, 'Look at this car that cost me so much money, look at this Champagne.' It's super fun.|Lorde|Money, Fun, Me 
Suburban sprawl leads to social atomisation and fragmentation and is environmentally disastrous, as carbon-intensive car journeys displace local shops and replace public transport.|Richard Rogers|Transport, Social, Replace 
I don't believe in the electric cars, but I strongly believe in hybrids.|Luca Cordero di Montezemolo|Believe, Electric Cars 
A Republican philosophy goes something like this: If you take your car to the mechanic, and instead of fixing it, they take out the engine and charge you an arm and a leg, you should conclude that mechanics can't fix cars and you should probably just take yours to the junkyard and sell it for scrap metal.|Keith Ellison|Philosophy, You, Mechanic 
After I joined Toyota, there was a period when I drove more than 200 cars in one year - different types, other companies' cars. I want to be able to tell what distinguishes one car from the next.|Akio Toyoda|Want, Different, Year 
Russia does not have a modern economy: it's a petro-power. The only thing it sells that the world wants to buy is oil and natural gas. When was the last time anyone bought a Russian computer? A Russian car? A Russian cell phone? Russia is so dependent on high energy prices that if oil falls below $100 a barrel, the Kremlin can't meet payroll.|Kathleen Troia McFarland|Time, Cell Phone, World 
As the son of a racing car designer and mechanical engineer, I was exposed to motorsports from day one.|Charlie Kimball|Day, Son, Racing 
Deprived of the opportunity to judge one another by the cars we drive, New Yorkers, thrown together daily on mass transit, form silent opinions based on our choices of subway reading. Just by glimpsing the cover staring back at us, we can reach the pinnacle of carnal desire or the depths of hatred. Soul mate or mortal enemy.|David Rakoff|Daily, Opportunity, Together 
There are signs, I think, that people aren't satisfied by consumerism: that people resent the fact that the most moral decision in their lives is choosing what colour their next car will be.|J. G. Ballard|Decision, People, Moral 
I just love cars I've been like that since I was a kid. It's an infatuation because we grew up poor. Cars was something we were always trying to get. |Birdman|Love, Trying, Poor 
With this film, 'Need For Speed,' with this, we had a blank canvas to work with. What we had to do was have fast cars, and that's it.|Aaron Paul|Work, Speed, Fast 
I remember one day, when things were going frightfully well, I went to buy myself a really smashing car. I asked them to show me a Porsche with an automatic gearbox, and the salesman called over all the other salesmen, and they stood around absolutely roaring with laughter.|Mary Quant|Day, Myself, Laughter 
To look out of a car in Scania, you see a painting on the horizontal - one windmill, one tiny farmhouse, acres of beet or grass.|Kenneth Branagh|Painting, You, See 
Why make a movie about Ayrton Senna? Someone who drove around in circles at 200mph in a car that looked like a giant cigarette packet? Why would anyone who isn't already a fan of Formula 1 care?|Asif Kapadia|Care, Why, Like 
When you're setting up a budget, a general rule is to start with your fixed expenses - your housing and insurance payments, and car payment, if you own one.|Jean Chatzky|Start, Budget, Insurance 
Beijing was such a different city. There were so few cars, I could walk in the middle of the road. In the summer, the streetlamps attracted swirling bugs. I loved those bugs: crickets, praying mantis, all kinds of beetles. I also have a vivid memory of dazzling sunlight coming out of the sky.|Ma Jun|Sky, Road, Memory 
I'm way flashier on Instagram and Snapchat because I feel like that's what people want to see, and that's I've always done, so I'm not going to stop. People want to see my cars and my purses. People love fashion. But that's so not me.|Kylie Jenner|Love, Me, People 
When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.|Sebastian Thrun|Best, Best Friend, Lost 
Car ownership as we know it will change. The promise of car ownership of the past, the freedom of open roads... the reality has been more of a burden.|John Zimmer|Change, Freedom, Past 
When I was growing up as a young lesbian in the '50s, I looked in vain for books about my people. I did find some paperbacks with lurid covers in the local bus station, but they ended with the gay character's committing suicide, dying in a car crash, being sent to a mental hospital, or 'turning' heterosexual.|Nancy Garden|Character, Growing Up 
Now and then, when I grow nostalgic about my ocean childhood - the wauling of gulls and the smell of salt, somebody solicitous will bundle me into a car and drive me to the nearest briny horizon.|Sylvia Plath|Ocean, Childhood, Me 
Whatever I think of, that's what I do. I wake up and think, 'I want to buy a car', I buy a car. I wake up and be like, 'I just want to lay in bed with my girl', I do that. I wake up and want to rap, I rap. So whatever I think of.|Young Thug|Girl, Wake Up, Want 
Beyond self-driving cars, I think all airplanes should go pilotless. Get the pilots out of there. Even better, have no cockpit at all, and turn it into a nice lounge with a bar. Why give people the illusion of control with a steering wheel?|Steve Jurvetson|Control, People, Nice 
Maybe I'm the only footballer who isn't interested in cars. My Lancia Y gets me around.|Gianluigi Buffon|Me, Footballer, Maybe 
Naming me 'Twinkle' was a foolproof way of making sure that I would get teased throughout my life, have immigration officers at various airports stare at my passport and shake with hysterical laughter, and strangers stalk me with WhatsApp messages like, 'Twinkle, Twinkle, little star, I hope you get hit by a car!'|Twinkle Khanna|Life, Hope, Laughter 
When I turned 16 and got my license, the Chevy Blazer was passed down from my sister, so it was very much a starter car.|Amy Purdy|Sister, Down, Blazer 
Every home that I have is paid for, every car that I have is paid for, and I am a hundred-million-dollar man. I mean, this is the truth; it's not a lie.|Floyd Mayweather, Jr.|Home, Truth, I Am 
Stephanie and I got married publicly on the beach, in front of friends and family, and the local police shut down the highway for us to cross the street back to my cousin's house. Cars backed up for miles, and everybody in town cheered.|Tig Notaro|Family, Friends, Beach 
Divorced men are more likely to meet their car payments than their child support obligations.|Susan Faludi|Support, Men, Child 
Luck, like a Russian car, generally only works if you push it.|Tom Holt|Luck, Push, You 
Simply racing a Formula 1 car is an achievement.|Sebastian Vettel|Achievement, Racing, Formula 
I was a little troublemaker. Always trying to get in trouble, always mischief, like throwing rocks at cars when I was younger, all that kind of stuff.|Ryan Lochte|Trying, Rocks, Kind 
I don't think I'm a celebrity. I'm just a guy from east Texas who loves cars and airplanes.|Carroll Shelby|Texas, Think, Celebrity 
We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year's car would have even if it's small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.|Jenson Button|Hope, Small Things, Small 
I'm fascinated by the narrative of geology, and I'm a veritable pack rat of a collector on the road. I keep a rock hammer in my car.|Marianne Wiggins|Road, Rock, Rat 
The Italians and Spanish, the Chinese and Vietnamese see food as part of a larger, more essential and pleasurable part of daily life. Not as an experience to be collected or bragged about - or as a ritual like filling up a car - but as something else that gives pleasure, like sex or music, or a good nap in the afternoon.|Anthony Bourdain|Life, Music, Food 
Move to Italy. I mean it: they know about living in debt; they don't care. I stayed out there for five months while I was making a film called 'Order Of Death,' and they've really got it sussed. Nice cars. Sharp suits. Great food. Stroll into work at 10. Lunch from 12 till three. Leave work at five. That's living!|John Lydon|Work, Food, Death 
One of the things that's interesting to me is I find things like caffeine and stunts actually relax me. When they're putting a bit of gel on my arm and lighting me on fire, or when I'm about to go into a high-speed car chase or rev a motorcycle up pretty fast, I find everything else around me slows down.|Nicolas Cage|Motorcycle, Fire, Relax 
I find people interesting. People trying hard are interesting. People with a passion are interesting - whether it's old cars or taxidermy or knitting.|Clare Balding|Passion, People, Trying 
It's not good just to have life experience of film-making and that's all. It's hard to play a real person when you've been in jets and town cars for three years.|Ryan Gosling|Life, Good, Experience 
My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn't have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.|Tim Allen|Best, Wife, Understanding 
Caution is the key to safe cycling. I'm aware that cars are bigger than me, but I feel quite safe. I'm in control, liberated and free, when I'm on my bike.|Erin O'Connor|Control, Me, Bike 
I love driving my car on any highway.|Virat Kohli|Love, Driving, Highway 
I've always saved. I believe in keeping money back for a rainy day and living within my means. I don't buy expensive clothes; I have a 10-year-old car I'm hoping to replace when a big job comes in. I suppose when we do go on family holidays, I am quite happy to spend when we are there.|Sanjeev Bhaskar|Family, Happy, Money 
I had a friend who was a plastic surgeon, so he would do little things. I never had, like, a full thing. So I would go in maybe once every two or three years, and he'd do a little here, a little there; tweak you, like you tweak your car. Then I became the plastic surgery poster girl.|Joan Rivers|Little Things, Girl, Friend 
Parallel parking is desirable for two reasons: parked cars create a physical barrier and psychological buffer that protects pedestrians on the sidewalk from moving vehicles; and a rich supply of parallel parking can eliminate the need for parking lots, which are extremely destructive of the civic fabric.|James Howard Kunstler|Moving, Rich, Create 
We designed a car that is for daily commutes and that you charge every day. The less you use the gasoline engine, the better mpg. Essentially, the Karma can achieve dramatic savings and low CO2 output when used as intended, as a daily commuter.|Henrik Fisker|Daily, Day, Karma 
If I can drive down the road in my car and listen to XM satellite, and when a song gets beamed into my car, it can tell me who wrote the song and what the damn lyrics are, why, when you broadcast a digital signal of a film, can't it speak to your television to set up a list of settings to show the film in the way that it was meant to be shown?|Jeff Nichols|Road, Speak, Me 
I always think of the good comebacks on the car ride home.|Ron Howard|Home, Good, Think 
I don't like to feel like I'm in a club when I'm in my car and I turn on the radio. Anything that ceases to be a song and just sounds like house music kind of stresses me out.|Taylor Swift|Music, Song, Me 
Liberals want the government to get bigger, and they want you to drive smaller cars, and they want to dictate the way you live.|Rush Limbaugh|Government, Live, Want 
Cars mean nothing to me. I'm not a car guy.|Penn Jillette|Me, Nothing, Mean 
If you're in a car crash, you're mostly involved in trying to not go off the bridge, and later on you say, 'Oh my God!'|Ben Bernanke|God, Bridge, You 
I have some wonderful suits in my closet, a lovely car, some refined watches.|Pierce Brosnan|Watches, Suits, Lovely 
I did not want to spend the rest of my life not being able to ride in a nice car.|Shakira|Life, My Life, Nice 
Cars can have a hypnotic effect. You can get in a car and get out and not really remember the trip.|Ryan Gosling|Remember, You, Effect 
From the 1920s into the 1940s, Britain's standard of living was supported by oil from Iran. British cars, trucks, and buses ran on cheap Iranian oil. Factories throughout Britain were fueled by oil from Iran. The Royal Navy, which projected British power all over the world, powered its ships with Iranian oil.|Stephen Kinzer|Power, World, Navy 
Enough Americans saw fit to give president Obama a second term. I don't think there will be many people keeping their Romney/Ryan bumper stickers on their cars.|Henry Rollins|People, Think, President 
Flying cars are not a very efficient way to move things from one point to another.|Bill Gates|Flying, Way, Point 
When Ford sells a car, a dealer isn't allowed to take out the engine and put a different one in. When a newsstand sells the Washington Post, no one can go to the newsstand and pay them to rip out the classified section and put their own classified section in - if they could, they would do so.|Bill Gates|Washington, Different, Post 
Some day you will be wheeled in for a heart bypass operation, and a surgeon will be the person who is now behind the counter when you renew your car registration at the department of motor vehicles.|P. J. O'Rourke|Day, Heart, You 
I come from Toledo, Ohio, a town that has been hurt badly by the shift of the automobile business towards Japan. And yet I remember how the car workers lived in the neighborhood that I grew up in. My father was a car salesman, and I remember how we lived. I remember how modestly we lived.|P. J. O'Rourke|Business, Father, Hurt 
I spent a lot of time behind the Iron Curtain, and their cars were abysmal.|P. J. O'Rourke|Time, Iron, Behind 
I like Michael Moore, but I think of him more as a rabble-rouser. On his TV show, when he went to the home of the guy who invented the car alarm and set off all the car alarms on the block... pretty funny.|P. J. O'Rourke|Funny, Home, Think 
When I'm in the car, I want the only one shouting to be me.|P. J. O'Rourke|Me, Want, Only 
Cars let us out of the barn and, while they were at it, destroyed the American nuclear family. As anyone who has had an American nuclear family can tell you, this was a relief to all concerned.|P. J. O'Rourke|Family, American, You 
My whole family can talk. They are all car salesmen. They are all funny.|P. J. O'Rourke|Funny, Family, Talk

As a little boy, I wanted to be a policeman. And then as I got older, and I saw my dad in the car business, an automobile executive.|Mitt Romney|Business, Boy, Little 
I love cars; I like the idea of manufacturing something, having a product, a hard product to sell and promote, but as time went on, I recognized that car companies are so bureaucratic and so ossified that it would take forever to work your way up. And so I went into consulting.|Mitt Romney|Love, Work, Time 
My dad was phenomenal. Born in Mexico, lived poor, didn't graduate from college, and becomes head of a car company and then governor of a state. I can't imagine I would have ever thought about running for office had I not seen my dad do it.|Mitt Romney|College, Thought, Company 
I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.|Mitt Romney|American, Hurt, Nothing 
Rebellion is what you make of it. When you've been on a tour bus for two months straight, and then you get in your car and drive wherever you want, that can feel rebellious.|Taylor Swift|Rebellion, Want, You 
Things in themselves have no life in them. A car can't comfort or encourage you. A house means nothing if there's no life and love inside.|Joyce Meyer|Love, Life, Comfort 
I tell people, and it's the truth, I could sit in my garage for a week and it won't make me a car. And you can sit in church till your bottom is flat and that won't make you a servant of Christ.|Joyce Meyer|Truth, Week, Me 
I have an answering machine in my car. It says, I'm home now. But leave a message and I'll call when I'm out.|Steven Wright|Home, Message, Machine 
I'm gonna be making records anyway, even if I had to sell 'em out of the trunk of my car. I'm that kind of musician and singer.|Dolly Parton|Kind, Sell, Records 
Nobody can ever make enough money for as many poor relatives as I've got. Somebody's got a sick kid, or somebody needs an operation, somebody ain't got this, somebody ain't got that. Or to give the kids all a car when they graduate.|Dolly Parton|Money, Sick, Kids 
Canadians can easily 'pass for American' as long as we don't accidentally use metric measurements or apologize when hit by a car.|Douglas Coupland|American, Long, Apologize 
If God drives a car, He'd drive a 1973 Ford LTD Brougham sedan with a claret-colored vinyl roof, with oxblood leather upholstery and an opera window.|Douglas Coupland|God, Window, Drive 
Theater in New York is nearer to the street. In London, you have to go deep into the building, usually, to reach the place where theater happens. On Broadway, only the fire doors separate you from the sidewalk, and you're lucky if the sound of a police car doesn't rip the envelope twice a night.|Tom Stoppard|Deep, Fire, Night 
Tesla is becoming a real car company.|Elon Musk|Company, Real, Becoming 
Winning 'Motor Trend' Car of the year is probably the closest thing to winning the Oscar or Emmy of the car industry.|Elon Musk|Winning, Year, Oscar 
A Prius is not a true hybrid, really. The current Prius is, like, 2 percent electric. It's a gasoline car with slightly better mileage.|Elon Musk|Better, True, Like 
I think Tesla will most likely develop its own autopilot system for the car, as I think it should be camera-based, not Lidar-based. However, it is also possible that we do something jointly with Google.|Elon Musk|Google, Think, System 
Some companies out there quote a start of production that is substantially in advance of when customers get their cars.|Elon Musk|Start, Production, Customers 
I like the word 'autopilot' more than I like the word 'self-driving.' 'Self-driving' sounds like it's going to do something you don't want it to do. 'Autopilot' is a good thing to have in planes, and we should have it in cars.|Elon Musk|Good, Want, You 
The U.S. automotive industry has been selling cars the same way for over 100 years, and there are many laws in place to govern exactly how that is to be accomplished.|Elon Musk|Way, Place, Selling 
People concerned about inflation today tend to buy big houses and nice cars.|Robert Kiyosaki|Today, People, Nice 
Regardless of what our national credit rating is, people will always want a roof over their heads, food on their tables, fuel for their cars, and clothes on their backs.|Robert Kiyosaki|Food, People, Want 
Let's overwhelm the Castro regime with iPhones, iPads, American cars and American ingenuity.|Rand Paul|American, Overwhelm, Castro

The creative process is mysterious; a conversation, a ride in the car, or a melody can trigger something.|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu|Creative, Conversation, Ride 
'Amores Perros' is three stories that interconnect in one moment, which is the car accident.|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu|Moment, Three, Which 
If I had been at an assembly line for films, I don't know if I would be the best driver. I think I would have crashed the car.|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu|Best, Know, Think

I was a pizza delivery boy at the Pizza Oven in Canton. I wanted to get fired so bad, I actually wrecked the delivery car, but they wouldn't fire me because I was the only person they had working there.|Marilyn Manson|Pizza, Fire, Me 
If a kid is old enough to drive a car or buy a gun, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager, should someone else be blamed because he isn't as enlightened as an eighteen-year-old?|Marilyn Manson|Gun, Drive, Responsible 
My hair is way, way long. I've hitchhiked across the country a zillion times. I've ridden in every car. I was never a hippie. It takes more than long hair.|Penn Jillette|Hair, Long, Country 
To drive a car in rural America is freedom. Before I had a car, I'd never seen a rock and roll show, I'd never seen a comic or a show.|Penn Jillette|Freedom, America 
I've never revved my car at a light for an attractive woman or an auto-rival, not even as a joke.|Penn Jillette|Light, Woman, Never 
It's always the big question in our lives if you have a lot of success. What do you do with it? Buy more houses, buy more cars, buy more stuff, be wealthy and distant and unengaged? Or do you take all that good fortune that has come towards you and spread the love, do something with it?|Kevin Spacey|Love, Success, Good 
I'm not someone who wears shades all the time and ducks into a darkened car in case I'm recognized - that would be absolute misery.|Ian Mckellen|Time, Shades, Someone 
If you come down to it, there's only a handful of worlds that action films live in. You have your car chases, your gun fights, and your fights.|James Wan|Action, Live, Gun 
I think, ultimately, if you create characters that people like and can relate to, your characters are grounded on a human level even if your cars are not.|James Wan|People, Think, You 
I never saw anything funny in a car commercial - but that's OK. Whatever they wanted to do - it's their product and I'm the spokesperson, and I'm going to deliver.|Bill Cosby|Funny, Product, Anything 
Both of my parents have been actors there were a lot of show tunes on in the car all of the time. I grew up with that. |Daniel Radcliffe|Time, Parents, Up 
I don't know what to do with it. I'm very fortunate to have it, and it gives you room to maneuver. But the main thing about having money is it means you don't have to worry about it. And that for me is a lovely thing. It's not for fast cars and hookers.|Daniel Radcliffe|Money, Me, Worry 
My parents were what I like to call proper musical fans. Lots of Sondheim was played in the car.|Daniel Radcliffe|Parents, Fans, Like 
People who have car collections - I never understood that. I always thought that was unnecessary. It's not beautiful, it's not creative. It's just showing how much money you've got.|Daniel Radcliffe|Beautiful, Money, Creative 
I grew up listening to show tunes in the back of the car.|Daniel Radcliffe|Listening, Up, Back 
There are races and then there are races. And without a doubt, the Indy 500 is the race that I've always wanted to attend. And now, to be driving the Corvette Pace Car... this is going to be unbelievable.|Guy Fieri|Driving, Doubt, Race 
I have to have energy because I have a lot of expenses. A couple of cars, couple of dogs and a big estate.|Don Rickles|Energy, Dogs, Expenses 
I've spent more on my Dodger tickets that I did on my car.|Shia LaBeouf|More, Spent, Did 
My first car, I got it in an auction at my temple. It was an '86 Volvo that I got for 500 bucks, and then wound up throwing $10,000 into the stereo system and put TVs in the foot rests. It was the most ridiculous Volvo you'd ever seen, but I had never had money before and I was out of my mind.|Shia LaBeouf|Money, Mind, You 
I don't have any expensive habits. I'm not a car collector or any of that nonsense. But I'd love to be incredibly wealthy for no reason at all.|John Lydon|Love, Habits, Reason 
I don't have huge bank accounts. I'd love one. But it wouldn't change much. I don't have any expensive habits. I'm not a car collector or any of that nonsense. But I'd love to be incredibly wealthy for no reason at all.|John Lydon|Love, Change, Habits 
The most important loan to pay is your student loan. It's more important than your mortgage, car and credit card payments. You cannot discharge student loan debt in the majority of cases.|Suze Orman|Student, Credit, You 
The prenup needs to be drawn up months before the wedding, not days - it's not something you slap together and sign in the car on the way to the ceremony. A shotgun prenup might not hold up in court.|Suze Orman|Wedding, Together, You 
Everything I've been thinking, every vision, even down to every shot I throw, it just ends up here in reality. Whether it was in a fight and how to react or whether it was in a stadium with screaming fans or whether I was in a fancy car or the best clothes ever, I always put myself somewhere.|Conor McGregor|Best, Myself, Vision 
I don't mind a little Sturm und Drang. When I was doing 'Riding in Cars With Boys,' I wouldn't smile at anybody, because my character, Bev, was angry at the world. I'm the opposite. Inside my head I'd be like, God, I'll explain to you at the end of shooting that I'm not this person.|Drew Barrymore|Smile, Character, God 
At least in making an action film, there's always going to be someone who wants to see a car chase. Even if a lot of the people don't like it, there will be a lot of people that do. But bad comedy is just garbage.|Jason Statham|Action, People, Comedy 
I'm into all things German. Everything that I own is German. As far as cars go, anyway.|Jason Statham|Everything, Far, Things 
I've always had a fascination with cars and racing, not that I've ever competed.|Jason Statham|Racing, Always, Fascination 
During the season, most of my time to unwind is in my car ride home. When I get home, it's being with my kids.|Tom Brady|Time, Home, Season 
I think I'm a survivor. I could have suffered at least 100 professional deaths. I could come up with a list of the 100 times I've come closest to death, from having pneumonia as a child to car crashes.|Craig Venter|Death, Child, Professional 
We've become such a multitasking society that just paying attention to the road doesn't seem to be that important anymore. I have to remind my kids all the time that that's what you're supposed to be doing in the car.|Andie MacDowell|Time, Road, Society 
A car is a 2,000 pound projectile that can go 100 miles an hour.|Jesse Ventura|Miles, Go, Hour

I sing in full voice in the car and have a tendency to harmonize badly.|Brad Goreski|Voice, Full, Sing 
I've actually stopped tinting my windows because the paparazzi look for trucks and cars with supertinted windows.|Megan Fox|Windows, Look, Trucks 
I don't think any rapper can go back. You can be a car salesman, a bank teller - I mean, really good jobs, and people are still gonna look at you and be like, 'You used to rap; what happened?'|Jay-Z|Good, People, Think 
I never wanted to just glamorize the playa lifestyle and not touch on the down side. I wanted everyone who's in a desperate situation to know that, if they wanna choose that kinda lifestyle, they gotta be aware of everything that comes with it! It's not just about the cars, the ladies and the money.|Jay-Z|Money, Situation, Know 
I would love to be on 'Top Gear' as a star in a reasonably priced car.|Sandra Bullock|Love, Star, Gear 
Guns do kill. Unlike cars, that is all they do.|Molly Ivins|Guns, Unlike 
Why young men from the country become firefighters is hard to explain to people who are not from the country. For most of us, it's not about the rush, which fades with time, or the paycheck. We could earn more working for the railroad or a car dealership. I figure it's about the land.|Matthew Desmond|Time, Men, People 
I cannot drive very well. I drive slow and very safe. I don't know cars that well.|Selena Gomez|Slow, Drive, Know 
When my mother and I walked to the grocery store, men would circle the block in cars. It was very, very scary, especially as a young boy. Very predatory - a hunt.|Ryan Gosling|Mother, Men, Circle 
First of all, I have to have trucks because I live most of my time on a horse farm, so I've gotta have trucks. It's in the northeast; I've got to have pickup trucks to move snow, number one. Number two, just if I'm driving, I don't have to have an SUV, but I want a big car.|Denis Leary|Time, Horse, Live 
I talk to myself, especially in the car.|Chris Pine|Myself, Talk 
I love the '40s. I love the '50s. I love the style, I love the clothes. I love how the women looked. I love the dances. I love the music. I love the amber of the light. I'm just in love with the cars. I'm in love with all of it.|Chris Pine|Love, Music, Women 
A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood.|Shakira|Man, Ego, Manhood

I have a Chevy Impala that I roll around in and a '89 Jeep Wrangler, which is the first car I ever bought. It has 180,000 miles on it, and that is my daily whip. I take that everywhere. Don't forget where you came from, that's why I'll never get rid of that Jeep.|John Cena|Daily, Why, You 
White is actually one of my favorite colors. I have a white car. I love white.|Kim Kardashian|Love, Colors, Favorite 
Every system I have in my house or my car, they're all tuned exactly the same.|Jimmy Iovine|House, System, Same 
The relentless invisible storm of radio signals and electronic particles, the hustle and bustle, and the billions of petrol explosions in the engine blocks of trucks and cars seem to churn up the molecules of life and heaven so violently that the beautiful fogs are unable to hold together like they once did.|Michael Leunig|Life, Beautiful, Together 
Would this country be better off if no one drank? Yes, it would be, but we tried that; it doesn't work. I don't want to tell anybody that they can't have as many drinks as they want every single night of the week as long as they don't get behind the wheel of a car.|Gary Johnson|Work, Week, Night 
If I go onstage, I want to give people everything they want and more. I'll wash their car for them on their way out.|Trent Reznor|People, Want, Way 
Now that I have a thousand albums in my car all the time, I listen to more music. I was too lazy; I always had the same five discs in there. I'd never think to change it.|Trent Reznor|Change, Music, Time 
Back when Detroit was the head of auto manufacturing, it was clear where profits were created. Right? A car was made in Detroit. There was little argument that you could make that some of the money from that should be sent overseas to Ireland.|Charles Duhigg|Money, Argument, You 
Even though it's hard to learn how to back your car out the driveway at first, once it becomes a habit, you can do it almost automatically and think about something else, like the meeting that you need to go to today or what's on the radio.|Charles Duhigg|Today, You Can Do It 
I'm really proud of 'Cars.' 'Cars,' when it first came out, got probably the most mediocre reviews of a Pixar film.|John Lasseter|Proud, Film, First 
'Cars' is simply near and dear to my heart.|John Lasseter|Heart, Dear, Near 
I'm a car nut. My father was a parts manager at a Chevrolet dealership.|John Lasseter|Father, Manager, Nut 
Car love is the sound of a throaty V-8 rumbling and revving, the acceleration throwing you back in the seat - especially when you get on a beautiful, winding road and the light's dappling through the trees.|John Lasseter|Love, Beautiful, Light 
'Cars' is a really personal story for me because, first of all, I grew up in Los Angeles - the car crazy capital.|John Lasseter|Crazy, Me, Story 
Obviously, movies, you're often on location, out in the rain or the sun, in a real place where the trees and the cars are real. But when you're on stage, as an actor you're imagining the environment that you're in.|Peter Jackson|Rain, Sun, Trees 
I never listen to the radio unless I rent a car.|David Byrne|Listen, Radio, Never 
There's a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you're self-propelled and decide exactly where to go. If you see something that catches your eye to the left, you can veer off there, which isn't so easy in a car, and you can't cover as much ground walking.|David Byrne|Freedom, Eye, Walking 
I'm not suggesting people abandon musical instruments and start playing their cars and apartments, but I do think the reign of music as a commodity made only by professionals might be winding down.|David Byrne|Music, Start, People 
I don't listen to the radio very much, but that could be because I don't have a car.|David Byrne|Listen, Radio, Because 
I hope that if you are employed full-time, you are doing it to ensure that basic needs are met and not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries.|Gordon B. Hinckley|Hope, Home, You 
For value investors, General Motors is a tempting target. The company's share of the North American auto market has steadily declined for two decades, and analysts say the company suffers from weak management and unexciting cars.|Alex Berenson|Management, Value, American 
I've got a role in the new Billy Bob Thornton movie that Billy Bob wrote and is going to direct called 'Jayne Mansfield's Car.' I only have four scenes, but I have as much dialogue as anybody in the movie.|Ron White|New, Dialogue, Role 
You can get into a very fancy car and know everything about the engine, but when you drive in that car, you feel that rush. In the same way, I think the more you know about love, the more you can enjoy it. And knowing about your personality type, who you are and what kind of person you're dealing with gives you a great leg up.|Helen Fisher|Love, Great, Personality 
A Rolex watch or an expensive car are the things guys often use to show status, wealth, and basic desirability.|Helen Fisher|Wealth, Show, Watch 
I know some people who live this much more insulated life in Los Angeles, where their feet never touch public ground. They walk out of their bathroom, their living room, they get into their garage, their car, and the next thing you know, they're at the valet parking of the restaurant or the store or the office. They're in a bubble the whole time.|Alec Baldwin|Life, Time, Walk 
Everything I hated about L.A. I'm beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. I used to hate that.|Alec Baldwin|Hate, Beginning, Live 
Hollywood studios bury that stuff - actors who punch directors in the face and try to run producers over with cars - insanity, criminal behavior. But the studios are invested in that star, they can't have that person's name dirtied up.|Alec Baldwin|Name, Behavior, Face 
I probably wouldn't be a good spokesman for an electric car, because I'll still get on a private jet, and one flight on a private jet undoes all my electric-car good deeds.|George Clooney|Good, Flight, Good Deeds 
Who buys French cars? Not me.|Karl Lagerfeld|Me, Who, Buys 
When I got the job on 'Lost,' I was a broke university student living in the crappiest part of town, with a duct-taped back window on a broken-down car. I existed on peanut butter and tea.|Evangeline Lilly|Job, Lost, Window 
My first-ever car, my parents bought me a red Fiat Uno. I was 17 and just so happy to have a car, so I was very fortunate that my parents were in a position to get me one - it was a secondhand car, but I was just so happy to have it.|Victoria Beckham|Happy, Parents, Red 
We need to stop flying, stop driving cars and jetting around on marine recreational vehicles.|Paul Watson|Flying, Driving, Stop 
Robots already perform many functions, from making cars to defusing bombs - or, more menacingly, firing missiles. Children and adults play with toy robots, while vacuum-cleaning robots are sucking up dirt in a growing number of homes and - as evidenced by YouTube videos - entertaining cats.|Peter Singer|Children, Cats, Robots 
When I was writing 'Kitchen Confidential,' I was in my 40s, I had never paid rent on time, I was 10 years behind on my taxes, I had never owned my own furniture or a car.|Anthony Bourdain|Time, Writing, Kitchen 
Honestly, the average American spends about 52 minutes a day in commute traffic. And as much as I love driving my car and many people like driving their car, commuting has never been fun for me.|Sebastian Thrun|Love, Day, American 
Meat is a mighty contributor to climate change and other environmental problems. The amount of meat we're eating is one of the leading causes of climate change. It's as important as the kind of car you drive - whether you eat meat a lot or how much meat you eat.|Michael Pollan|Change, Environmental 
I used to take my car and go down to the South Island for five or six days and climb glaciers and jump out of planes and jump off bridges and go white water rafting - a bit of thrill-seeking.|Luke Evans|Water, Bridges, Climb 
I'm as passionate as any car owner or car collector that has one car or 300 cars.|Bill Goldberg|Passionate, Owner, Collector 
I've spent a lot of time in a rock n' roll band trying to fight off the fact that I was old enough to rent a car. And it's all sort of rushed in at once now. And I like it.|Jason Isbell|Time, Fight, Trying 
Two of my grandparents died in a car crash. Sucks, 'cause they would have lived to a hundred.|Kid Rock|Grandparents, Lived, Two 
To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car. The only reason I wanted to make money as an actor was because I'm passionate about food!|Hugh Jackman|Food, Money, Father 
I don't think Bond does too much; he's just suave and sexy. He rolls out with his martini and fancy cars. Wow, it sounds like my life already.|Priyanka Chopra|Life, My Life, Think 
Humans are unbelievably data efficient. You don't have to drive 1 million miles to drive a car, but the way we teach a self-driving car is have it drive a million miles.|Jeff Bezos|Data, Drive, You 
In today's YouTube world, are officers reluctant to get out of their cars and do the work that controls violent crime? Are officers answering 911 calls but avoiding the informal contact that keeps bad guys from standing around, especially with guns?|James Comey|Work, Today, World 
I have a car in Nebraska. When I bought it, they gave me a satellite radio, and there's an 'indie-rock' station. It's just nothing I'm interested in.|Conor Oberst|Me, Radio, Nothing 
Cars and cameras are the two things I let myself be materialistic about. I don't care about other stuff.|Louis C. K.|Myself, Care, Two 
I'm someone who's always on the go and crazy busy, so I like to keep snacks in my car and at the office, and Cracker Jack'd is a really yummy snack that I love. I definitely am a big snacker.|Ashley Tisdale|Love, Crazy, Busy 
It just seemed too weird to me. I don't know, maybe they were smoking a joint in the car downstairs from their parents' apartment. I had to go that far to put together a scenario of how they could have possibly recognized me.|Marc Jacobs|Together, Parents, Me 
The parents of teenagers would love to have a car that won't go very far or go very fast. They could just cruise around the neighborhood, drive it to school, see their friends, plug it in overnight.|Clayton Christensen|Love, Friends, Parents 
People tend to cherish and take care of the things they pay for and therefore own, countries included. The opposite is also true. When was the last time you changed the oil in a rental car?|Tucker Carlson|Time, People, Care 
A simple social engineering hack might involve leaving a thumb drive on the pavement close to the driver's door of a car.|John McAfee|Simple, Door, Leaving 
In Japan, they have TV sets in cars right now, where you can punch up traffic routes, weather, everything! You can get Internet access already in cars in Japan, so within the next 2 to 3 years it's gonna be so crazy!|Glenn Danzig|Weather, Crazy, Internet 
Everybody has a gun in their car in Detroit.|Jim Harrison|Gun, Detroit, Everybody 
Sometimes, I tell my wife I have to take a car trip and collect new memories - I like to drive around at absolute random for weeks on end through the United States and parts of Canada. Or else I feel trapped, like you feel when your life is completely planned for months in advance, and you think you're not getting enough oxygen.|Jim Harrison|Life, Memories, Wife 
American stuntmen are smart - they think about safety. When they do a jump in a car, they calculate everything: the speed, the distance... But in Hong Kong, we don't know how to count. Everything we do is a guess. If you've got the guts, you do it. All of my stuntmen have gotten hurt.|Jackie Chan|Safety, Smart, American 
If Uber is lower-priced, then more people will want it. And if more people want it and can afford it, then you have more cars on the road. And if you have more cars on the road, then your pickup times are lower, your reliability is better. The lower-cost product ends up being more luxurious than the high-end one.|Travis Kalanick|Road, People, Want 
If there was a mobility service that's cheaper than owning a car, more reliable, and you get to sit in the back seat instead of being stressed out in the front seat, why would you own a car?|Travis Kalanick|Service, Why, You 
I want a Mini-Cooper because it's fuel efficient, emissions efficient and all that stuff. It's small and better for the environment. I think that will be my next car.|Christina Ricci|Small, Environment, Want 
My grandmother was probably the first person who I thought was beautiful. She was incredibly stylish, she had big hair, big cars. I was probably 3 years old, but she was like a cartoon character. She'd swoop into our lives with presents and boxes, and she always smelled great and looked great.|Tom Ford|Beautiful, Character, Great 
I went to Coachella once, and it was only to go see Leonard Cohen. I got in the car and sat through all the crazy traffic in L.A. to get there - instead of a two hour drive, it takes, like, six hours. Then I watched his set and turned around and left. I just so wanted to see him perform in the desert.|Hannah Simone|Crazy, Desert, See 
We must be aware of consumerism! That's our tendency. It's the capitalistic curse that we were poisoned with. We should spend only what is necessary. How do you call the big cars, the latest ones? Hummer! Not a single dollar to import Hummers! What is that? What is that? What kind of revolution is this? One of Hummers? No way!|Hugo Chavez|Revolution, You, Kind 
How we fund transportation in this country is broken. You all pay a gasoline tax, right? Well, cars go farther, we get electric cars, and so on. And then we do more with the money than just build roads. We do bike lanes and mass transit.|Kevin McCarthy|Money, Roads, Bike 
In the past there were people who were not rich but contented with their living style, laughing and happy all day. But when the new rich people appear, people look at them and ask, 'why don't I have a life like that too, a beautiful house, car and garden,' and they abandon their values.|Thich Nhat Hanh|Life, Happy, Beautiful 
I bought a lot of rubbish things that kids buy: skateboards and clothes and typical teenage stuff. And, as soon as I could, I wasted a lot of money on cars - BMW's mostly - for myself and my family.|Tom Felton|Family, Money, Myself 
I hate when someone drives my car and resets all the radio presets. I don't understand it. If I was ever driving someone's car, I would never touch the things that were set.|Will Ferrell|Hate, Driving, Understand 
It's worth noting that everything - from the Internet to electric cars, genomic sequencing, mobile apps, and social media - were pioneered by startups, not existing companies.|Steve Blank|Social Media, Internet 
Maybe our best family trip started at Victoria Falls, which drenches you with spray and is so vast that it makes Niagara Falls seem like a backyard creek. Then we rented a car and made our way to Hwange National Park, which was empty of people but crowded with zebras, giraffes, elephants and more.|Nicholas Kristof|Family, Best, People 
It's absurd that you know more about your car than you know about your body.|Kevin Plank|Body, Know, You 
Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very, very good. Spending $1,000 for a ham sandwich would feel very, very bad. Spending $19,000 for a small family car would feel, well, more or less right. But as with physical pain, fiscal pain can depend on the individual, and everyone has a different threshold.|Jeffrey Kluger|Family, Good, Pain 
If one wanted to find a modern symbol of personal freedom, the motor car is right there near the top of the list. But a car has come to mean much more than that. It has become a powerful statement about who you are and how much you earn.|Martin Jacques|Freedom, Powerful, You 
Creative industries are more important than the car industry, luxury jewels, and fashion.|Jean-Michel Jarre|Creative, Fashion, Luxury 
My boyfriend keeps telling me I've got to own things. So, first I bought this car. And then he told me I oughta get a house. 'Why a house?' 'Well, you gotta have a place to park the car.'|Julia Roberts|Me, Why, You 
Everyone would have bigger and safer cars if they didn't have those CAFE standards: corporate average fuel economy.|Grover Norquist|Economy, Fuel, Cafe 
VW has held a beloved place in American culture. When I graduated from college, many of my friends drove across the country, and most hit the road in a VW van or Bug. Through the years, these cars have represented youth, freedom and quirkiness.|Frances Beinecke|Friends, Freedom, Culture 
The last thing I want to do is complain; I love what I do, and I know every job comes with a downside. But boy, this one's a doozy...You pull out of your driveway, and the paparazzi literally chase you, running red lights - I'm a really careful driver, especially with my kids in the car, but I worry they're going to cause an accident.|Jennifer Garner|Love, Job, Red 
Just getting from the airport straight to the gym is gonna be your best bet to knock off that rust and wake yourself up and get that blood flowing. You sit in a car or a plane cramped up, you lose a lot of blood flow and get that swelling in your legs. There are all kinds of dangers in sitting still too long.|Roman Reigns|Best, Yourself, Long 
I drive a car, like an adult. Not brilliantly. I'm not great.|Karl Pilkington|Great, Drive, Like 
In 2010, I sold my car, a Toyota Majester, for just a lakh-and-a-half to be able to feed my horses. It continues to be like a hole, where I put all my money.|Randeep Hooda|Money, Like, Where 
I'm probably more dangerous in a car than I am on a motorbike; on a bike I'm very mindful of the fact that if you make a mistake, you're dead.|James McAvoy|I Am, Mistake, Bike 
Auto racing is boring except when a car is going at least 172 miles per hour upside down.|Dave Barry|Racing, Down, Upside Down 
I want a pit crew... I hate the procedure I currently have to go through when I have car problems.|Dave Barry|Hate, Problems, Want 
Be able to back up a car for a considerable distance in a straight line and back out of a driveway.|Marilyn vos Savant|Distance, Back Up, Straight 
One of the disadvantages of poetry over popular music is that if you write a pop song, it naturally gets into people's heads as they listen in the car. You don't have to memorize a Paul Simon song; it's just in your head, and you can sing along. With a poem, you have to will yourself to memorize it.|Billy Collins|Music, Poetry, Yourself 
I was kidnapped by Sunni insurgents near Fallujah, in Iraq, ambushed by the Taliban in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan, and injured in a car accident that killed my driver while covering the Taliban occupation of the Swat Valley in Pakistan.|Lynsey Addario|Driver, Car Accident, Valley 
Sometimes, when my wife and I were going out to dinner, I would take my laptop with me and work in the car, so as to take advantage of the half hour going and coming.|Thomas Friedman|Work, Wife, Me 
What it is basically, if you go to a gun show, and there's somebody out there in the parking lot, and they're getting out of their car, and they've got an A-15 on their shoulder, or... John Q. Public wants to sell a handgun or whatever, then there's no background check.|Phil Gingrey|Gun, You, Check 
I think many agree, being on the plan till 26, good idea; preexisting conditions, they all have a cost. So you have to find a way to pay for it. But it doesn't mean that you're going to keep or change. Listen, cars have tires. You can reinvent the car, but it's still going to have tires. Those aspects are components of healthcare.|Rick Santelli|Change, Good, Plan 
When I was drafted by the Colts, Indianapolis was a basketball and a car racing town, but it didn't take long for the Colts to convert the city and state of Indiana into football evangelists.|Peyton Manning|Football, City, Long 
It's crazy that you have to tell your phone or your computer or your house or your car 'It's me!' hundreds of times a day. Wearables will solve that problem.|Astro Teller|Day, Crazy, Me 
But I've never felt that being an actress is being in a comfortable place. It's seen from the outside that we're being driven in big cars and having these gorgeous suites and all of that. But come on, it's not about that.|Juliette Binoche|Place, Comfortable, Actress 
Boredom is a fearsome prospect. There's a limit to the number of cars and microwaves you can buy. What do you do then?|J. G. Ballard|Boredom, Limit, You 
There is a spiritual hunger in the world today - and it cannot be satisfied by better cars on longer credit terms.|Adlai E. Stevenson|Today, Spiritual, World 
I rememeber one time we were getting ready to go to South America and everything was packed up and in the car ready to go and I hid and I was crying because I really did not want to go, I wanted to play. I did not want to go.|Michael Jackson|Time, America, Want 
I always envied them, the owners of the cars with the white plates who can be seen around Jerusalem. I always wanted to be one of them. We call them U.N., even though U.N. are generally foreign correspondents with leased cars and yellow plates.|Sayed Kashua|Yellow, White, Always 
I do love cars.|Zlatan Ibrahimovic|Love 
The car has become the carapace, the protective and aggressive shell, of urban and suburban man.|Marshall McLuhan|Man, Become, Aggressive 
Here comes 40. I'm feeling my age and I've ordered the Ferrari. I'm going to get the whole mid-life crisis package.|Keanu Reeves|Age, Crisis, Feeling 
I'm big on having a blistering pace. That's one of the hallmarks of what I do, and that's not easy. I never blow up cars and things like that, so it's something else that keeps the suspense flowing. I try not to write a chapter that isn't going to turn on the movie projector in your head.|James Patterson|Easy, Chapter, Try 
Yeah, I left Idaho at 17. You know, I graduated high school a year early and just, you know, the typical story, packed up my car and moved out.|Aaron Paul|School, High School, Know 
I drive Fords, and I've driven American cars all my life, and I want to have a strong American manufacturing sector, especially in automobiles.|Jim DeMint|Life, Strong, American 
I collect vintage cars, so you always find them in my books.|Clive Cussler|Vintage, You, Find 
I write songs for people who drive in cars. I really do.|Melissa Etheridge|People, Drive, Write 
'The melancholy of all things done' is the way Buzz once described his complete mental breakdown after returning from the moon. Booze. A couple of divorces. A psych ward. Broke. At one point he was selling cars.|Jeanne Marie Laskas|Moon, Done, Selling 
I don't know how to drive a car.|Javier Bardem|Drive, Know, How 
I've always been attracted to cars, and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid, you're the slowest, and if you qualify first on the grid, you're the fastest. So no one can say you're slow if you're fast and no one can say you're fast if you're slow.|Eric Bana|Experience, Slow, You 
I grew up in Texas, and people love their American-made muscle cars there. I grew up around people who loved cars and took care of cars and my dad's a big car nut, so I learned a little bit about cars - how to love them, most importantly. I think that from the time I could remember, I've always envisioned myself in a vintage muscle car.|Amber Heard|Love, Time, Myself 
The only thing I know is that no one ever sat in a therapist's or a psychiatrist's room saying, 'My parents just loved me too much.' The only thing you can do is love them and be around. Kids don't really care what your car is like or how big their house is. All they really care about is that you are around.|James Corden|Love, Parents, Me 
Most critics of gender division are women, and they're worried about girls and the roles presented for them by gendered entertainments. They are quite right to be. Telling girls that the cars and the guns are beyond their domain of expertise, and that they should content themselves with clothes and friendships, is limiting.|Russell Smith|Women, Gender, Guns 
You want to make sure this particular car is going to please the customer and then you're going to be rewarded with something that is going to please the shareholder.|Carlos Ghosn|Customer, Want, You 
The problem is Twitter is designing the metaphorical equivalent of a Toyota Prius. A car for the masses. While I want a Formula One race car.|Robert Scoble|Problem, Want, Race 
If I can put on my album in a car or on my headphones and listen to the whole thing and love it, that's what I'm going to be happy putting out there.|Ed Sheeran|Love, Happy, Be Happy 
When you think of bike couriers, you think of hyper speed. They get paid by how fast they can drop stuff off. The faster you go, the more chances you take. And the more chances you take, the greater the war between cyclists and cars.|Dan Hill|War, Speed, Bike 
I can't just wear whatever when I go out because somebody might want to take a picture. People are, like, taking pictures of me in my car when I'm driving. It's crazy. I kind of hate it sometimes.|Bryson Tiller|Hate, Crazy, Me 
It turns out that if you optimize the performance of a car and of an airplane, they are very far away in terms of mechanical features. So you can make a flying car. But they are not very good planes, and they are not very good cars.|Gregory Benford|Good, Performance, Airplane 
I will sit in the car on the way to a meeting and just smile. I really mean that. It helps you get through life. If you have nothing to say, smile. Look up at the sky and smile. Just be grateful.|Andre Leon Talley|Life, Smile, Sky 
When it comes to cars, only two varieties of people are possible - cowards and fools.|Russell Baker|People, Fools, Two 
Growing up in Southern California, it's all car culture. When I was a kid, I knew every single model of every single car dealer; I knew every style of every year.|Cheech Marin|Culture, Style, Growing Up 
Every human being in this world is interested in certain things. Everybody has a hobby. Some people like art; I know nothing about it. Some people like books, some people like fishing, some people like music. I like to look at cars.|Bikram Choudhury|Music, Art, World 
Indian car buyers have not really been exposed to customer care in a competitive environment.|Ratan Tata|Customer, Environment, Care 
People of great power wield great power, but people of lesser power or people who have fallen out of power go to jail without adequate evidence, or their bodies are found in the trunks of cars.|Ratan Tata|Great, Power, People 
Since I got involved in Telco, we first developed the first modular truck, the 407, then the 709, and now the 2213. These trucks broke away from the old face of Telco trucks. I was also just as much involved with the Safari, but nobody talks about the Safari. My involvement has been there with all Telco's projects -somehow the car has got hyped up.|Ratan Tata|Face, Truck, Involvement 
In syndication, the biggest buyers are car dealerships.|Bill Engvall|Buyers, Biggest 
I don't listen to the radio in the car, and I do that because I don't want to be influenced.|Tom Scholz|Listen, Want, Radio 
Chrysler builds great cars.|Lee Iacocca|Great, Chrysler, Builds 
I grew up in a culture of motorbikes. So I like racing just fine. Quite a lot, actually. That was when I was a boy in Australia. And I never really made the jump to cars after that.|Chris Hemsworth|Culture, Racing, Jump 
It's like driving your car. If you drive too fast on the highway, you will topple, so you better maintain your speed. Life is similar to that, and that's the way you have to control your head.|A. R. Rahman|Life, Control, Speed 
When I was a kid, nobody in my family had a car. And I didn't have many toys. The only toys I had were the ones I would steal.|DMX|Family, Nobody, Toys 
The reason we have cancer and heart disease is the same reason you can't get rid of the wear and tear on your tires on your car: as soon as you use them, you are wearing them away. You can't make eternal tires, and it's the same with the human body.|S. Jay Olshansky|Heart, Body, Cancer 
Whenever I made money I invested in myself... I bought whatever I needed to make my career better. I never really spent money on other stuff, like buying expensive cars.|Tiesto|Money, Myself, Better 
I had more clothes than I had closets, more cars than garage space, but no money.|Sammy Davis, Jr.|Money, Space, Clothes 
Building a house from scratch in the middle of a field is a bit like building a prototype car. As with all prototypes, if you're building a car you usually have the luxury of producing several prototypes before you arrive at the production line version - so the opportunity for changing things is quite rich.|Kevin McCloud|Opportunity, Building, Rich 
My definition of a redundancy is an air-bag in a politician's car.|Larry Hagman|Politician, Definition 
Television is such an evolving medium. When you're doing a TV show, it's not like you just shoot for six weeks and you're in an editing room with all of your footage. It's like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what's not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.|Chris Pratt|Work, Guitar, Television 
Cities offer us powerful leverage on our most stubborn, wasteful practices. Long commutes in our cars, big power bills from our energy-hogging buildings, shopping trips to buy stuff that'll spend a few short months in our homes and long centuries in our landfills.|Alex Steffen|Power, Powerful, Short 
Every snapshot collector has obsessions. Some only collect photos of cars. Others like World War II, or babies, or old-timey girls in old-timey swimsuits. I happen to collect the weird stuff: photos that make the hair on the back of your neck stand up a little. The uncanny.|Ransom Riggs|War, Hair, World 
This generation is so dead. You ask a kid, 'What are you doing this Saturday?' and they'll be playing video games or watching cable, instead of building model cars or airplanes or doing something creative. Kids today never say, 'Man, I'm really into remote-controlled steamboats.'|Jack White|Today, Man, Video Games 
We need to bring Android and Chrome to every screen that matters for users, which is why we focused on phone, wearables, car, television, laptops, and even your workplace.|Sundar Pichai|Television, Why, Bring 
Failures are much more dramatic than successes, and people like drama. I think this is why automobile races draw such crowds. People expect spectacular crashes, which we tend to find more interesting than cars just racing around the track. The same is true of bridges, buildings, or any structure or machine.|Henry Petroski|People, Think, Drama 
I've made club songs, and I've made radio songs, and I've made the car songs.|T-Pain|Radio, Club, Made 
I do YouTube my cars a lot.|T-Pain|YouTube, Lot 
I could never drive in a great big car; people like me because I'm a man of the people, a hustler.|Terry McAuliffe|Great, Man, Me 
Yeah, I'm the Brit who isn't Lewis Hamilton that woke up and realised he was good. I got that tag because I was young, flying around in jets and driving fast cars. I always took my driving seriously, but I suppose I enjoyed life... But I'm not a playboy.|Jenson Button|Life, Good, Flying 
I keep my weight low, although you need to be able to move your weight around the race car to change the balance. I'm 6ft and I'm 70kg so I haven't much fat on me.|Jenson Button|Change, Balance, Me 
I always check my harness before I do a stunt I test-drive the cars I have to race or explode I'm present at all pyrotechnical rehearsals and I walk through everything step-by-step. No man should put their life in someone else's hands unless they have covered their own safety from all angles. |Akshay Kumar|Life, Man, Safety 
We approach people the same way we approach our cars. We take the poor kid to a doctor and ask, What's wrong with him, how much will it cost, and when can I pick him up?|James Hillman|Doctor, People, Way 
Being poor with three small children is terrifying. You can't make any plans. You know you're not going on holiday, ever. There's no way you could ever afford driving lessons or a car. And the guilt I used to feel: they had holes in their shoes, and at one point, I had to send them to school wearing Wellingtons when the sun was shining.|Sue Townsend|Children, School, Shoes 
There's something scary, knowing that in Florida, someone can pick you up in a car and drive you to 50 states. Back home, it's like, 'Girl, you're 15 minutes away.'|Grace Gealey|Home, Girl, You 
Well, you can say there is a self driving car. I'm seeing the automation of vehicles. Really, computer-assisted driving. I think that is really interesting to us because we are taking all of the sensors technologies and putting them in cars and making people safer.|Tony Fadell|Self, People, Think 
I take a lot of pride in the work I do, because people pay to see me. They've got to get babysitters, park their car, get popcorn and candy. I've got to be conscious of that.|Mr. T|Work, Pride, Me 
If I weren't skateboarding, I'd love to race cars. I like anything that's fast and active.|Ryan Sheckler|Love, Fast, Race 
I love driving. I still drive a 1993 Toyota Camry. I do want to get an electric car, but it's less of a carbon footprint if you keep your old, fuel-efficient car on the road than if you say 'build me a whole new car.'|Josh Fox|Love, Road, Me 
The car industry has invested a lot in hybrid, but my opinion is electric cars will take over a lot of hybrids quicker than people think now.|Henrik Fisker|People, Think, Opinion 
I really like driving cars. I love car games.|Kodi Smit-McPhee|Love, Driving, Games 
I'm an anorak. I've always been an obsessive collector of things. Richard Briers collects stamps. I collect cars and guns, which are much more expensive, and much more difficult to store.|Michael Gambon|Guns, Difficult, Always 
I remember reading 'The Hobbit' on a car trip from Ohio to Mississippi and getting out at a rest-stop in Mississippi and feeling jet-lagged at my return from Middle-earth.|Garth Risk Hallberg|Reading, Remember, Feeling 
Either the car is stationary, or it's on the move.|Murray Walker|Move, Stationary, Either 
Removing the faults in a stage-coach may produce a perfect stage-coach, but it is unlikely to produce the first motor car.|Edward de Bono|Perfect, First, Faults 
When I went to the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2002, I decided I wanted to leave my car at home and create an experiment with my own life. I'd only be able to find creative solutions to transportation if I felt the pain of trying to get to downtown at 10 o'clock at night.|Logan Green|Life, Home, Pain 
Those who have come into Formula One without experiencing cars devoid of electronic aids will find it tough. To control 800 horse power relying just on arm muscles and foot sensitivity can turn out to be a dangerous exercise.|Michael Schumacher|Power, Horse, Control 
People get excited around me and behave differently than they would normally. I don't feel different from anyone else, except that I drive a racing car round in circles faster than somebody else.|Michael Schumacher|Racing, Me, People 
Nothing impresses the ladies like a clean, pressed pair of khakis and a large pattern shirt featuring either classic cars, mojitos or men playing golf.|Tim Heidecker|Golf, Men, Nothing 
To this day, I still haven't touched one dime of my signing bonus or NFL contract money. I live off my marketing money and haven't blown it on any big-money expensive cars, expensive jewelry, or tattoos and still wear my favorite pair of jeans from high school.|Rob Gronkowski|Day, Money, School 
I drank a lot when I was a teenager and I don't drink any more, because that's when I thought, you know, I'm gonna end up a car wreck.|Kristin Davis|Thought, End, Know 
People get very thoughtful when they are in cars. I no longer care for cars. I don't collect them.|Mick Jagger|People, Thoughtful, Care 
I like structure - like driving: go past the school on the street, stay on the right side, no hitting the car, go in right, you'll see a big church, stop and take a left, and you'll have it. By doing this I'm giving a structure of life, a path of light, and showing what happens between me and me, which is something very beautiful.|Jean-Claude Van Damme|Life, Beautiful, Light 
If all the cars in the United States were placed end to end, it would probably be Labor Day Weekend.|Doug Larson|Day, End, Labor 
Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It's like a rush, I really enjoy that.|Sebastian Vettel|Enjoy, You, Everything 
We always kept believing in ourselves and our team and the car.|Sebastian Vettel|Team, Believing, Always 
When I leave the car park at Melwood, I try and become a completely different person. I try to get away from it. You have got to. Otherwise you end up like Jamie Carragher - obsessed!|Steven Gerrard|End, You, Try 
I've worked as a labourer, driven taxis and school buses, and been a car mechanic - whatever I could do just to get by. But it does mean that I know a little bit about a lot of things.|Cory Monteith|School, Know, Mean 
But I have a driver, so I can return calls while I'm in the car.|Donna Shalala|I Can, Driver, Return 
I wanted to send a message to the television industry that excitement is not made of car chases.|Gene Roddenberry|Television, Message 
My grandfather milked several cows twice a day and supplied the neighbours with dairy products. He liked to go visiting around the county on Saturdays, and he also enjoyed the neighbours when they came by once a week with their empty milk jars. He walked them out to their cars and hung over the driver's side window until they drove off.|Kary Mullis|Day, Week, Window 
We take better care of the maintenance of our cars than we take care of the maintenance of our bodies.|David H. Murdock|Better, Care, Take Care 
The reason I keep talking about a wife and saying the word 'wife' on stage is because it seems a funny word to me. The more you say it, the more it seems to detach from that person and become this sort of abstract thing: that you would set out to find a wife, that it would be an objective like buying a new car.|Stephen Merchant|Funny, Wife, Me 
Whirlyball is only the most awesome sport on the planet! It's like bumper cars plus lacrosse meets basketball.|St. Vincent|Awesome, Basketball, Like 
When I go to Indian reservations in the West, and especially to the Pine Ridge Reservation, I sometimes feel unsure where to put my foot when I open the car door.

When men have a smile on their faces, that does a lot for me.|Michelle Yeoh|Men, Me, Faces

And listen, when a camera is shoved in your face trying to take a selfie, you do not want to smile.|Chrissy Teigen|Love, Happy, Fun 
As a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense. When I started, the whole idea of the model was very different; it was a bit stuck-up. Not stuck-up, but no one was trying to have fun, or not even have fun, but be willing to smile.|Cara Delevingne|Fun, Stand, Have Fun 
I cry at anything remotely touching - smile at me warmly and I'm off... television also does it, everything from 'X-Factor' to cereal commercials. I cry when I am tired. I also cry when I laugh.|Natalie Massenet|I Am, Tired, Me

The 'good' mother, with her fixed smile, her rigidity, her goody-goody outlook, her obsession with unnecessary hygiene, is in fact a fool.

'Priced to sell' - just the phrase makes me smile. When a dealer says all the items in his booth are priced to sell, he means he's tagged them as aggressively as he can to get you to buy them. Don't worry, though, I still haggle. You have to. That's the point of a flea market.|Nate Berkus|Me, Worry, You 
I was never one of those surly teenagers who doesn't smile. My lovely godfather said it was always lovely to see me because I was the only teenager who smiled.

Bob Dylan has always sealed his decisions with the unexplainable. His motives for withholding the release of the magnificent 'Basement Tapes' will be as forever obscure as Brian Wilson's reasons for the destruction of the tapes for 'Smile.'|Jon Landau|Decisions, Forever, Obscure 
I have always loved a hard-faced girl. I get that Alison Goldfrapp isn't easy, and I like her belligerence. She's deeply sexy and controlled, like a Strict Machine, and it seems to wind the b'jesus out of the women I know. On the outside, I watch and smile and will her on like a twisted silent maiden aunt in the dark corner.|Alison Moyet|Women, Wind, Girl

I think we got that corrected.|Regis Philbin|Money, City, People

A smile costs about $240.|Roma Downey|Costs, About 
In Delhi, where I grew up, commerce is brusque. You don't ask each other how your day has been. You might not even smile. I'm not saying this is ideal - it's how it is. You're tied together by a transaction. The customer doesn't tremble before complaining about how cold his food is.|Karan Mahajan|Food, Day, Together 
If I am not mistaken, it was a British poet who said that 'no one is properly dressed unless he wears a smile.'|Sukarno|I Am, Said, Dressed

People need to understand that the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at the time. I had to step away for the sake of the machine. I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or know them well enough to like.|Lauryn Hill|Time, Beginning, Step 
It's very strange to go to cities like London and New York. People walk so quickly, they seem to be in a hurry all the time. And you don't say 'Hi' to everyone you meet, and you don't smile to everyone you meet, because there's just so many. Which is also very strange.|Aurora|Time, Walk, People

Smile, it's better than a poke in the eye.|Douglas Horton|Eye, Better, Than 
'Halal in the Family' will expose a broad audience to some of the realities of being Muslim in America.

Many people say I smile more in Africa than in Sweden.|Henning Mankell|People, Africa, People Say 
If I buy a Fiat Uno, I'll read that, for a man like me, a Ferrari was more suitable. If instead I buy a Ferrari, they'll write that I should have kept my feet on the ground and bought a Fiat.

I have my father's lopsided mouth. When I smile, my lips slope to one side. My doctor sister calls it my cerebral palsy mouth. I am very much a daddy's girl, and even though I would rather my smile wasn't crooked, there is something moving for me about having a mouth exactly like my father's.|Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|Sister, Father, I Am 
It is clear I was never the Pretty Girl. I had my two front teeth knocked out when I was 10 and didn't fix them until I was 19.

My whole face is off-center.|Ellen Barkin|Girl, Red, Me

I know virtually no one of my age who can remember a hug, or a smile from their father, or a 'Let's go play football.'|Peter Mullan|Age, Father, Football 
What I always think about when I think about 'Girls' is Lena being in a scene where she's very vulnerable, possibly directing, acting, and she's probably written the dialogue. It's 2 in the morning.

My grandmother, whom we call Biel, thinks it's very unbecoming of me not to smile for the paparazzi. So every time I see them, I think, 'Smile for Biel!'|Jessica Biel|Time, Me, Think 
In the car on my way to premieres and awards shows, I'll sit with tissue paper under my armpits so I don't soil the delicate dress fabric.

When I was a kid, I knew the black and white version of 'Jane Eyre,' and I guess I became interested in the idea of romantic love - of unrequited love and the tragedies of that; of what are the important things in life; what should one value over other materials.|Cary Fukunaga|Love, Life, Black And White 
The most impactful place that I've been to where I was just completely awestruck, happy, moved is Victoria Falls between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is probably the most beautiful and romantic place in the world.|Hill Harper|Happy, Beautiful, World

I'm not religious, I'm not romantic and I live purely by logic. I make every decision by logic and sometimes that leads me to the right and sometimes to the wrong decision.|Laura Marling|Decision, Me, Live 
I'm a teller of stories. I put bloody skins on my back and dance around the fire, and I say what the hunt was like. It's not erudite; it's not intellectual. I sail, run dogs, ride horses, play professional poker, and tell stories about the stuff I've been through. And I'm still a romantic; I still want Bambi to make it out of the fire.|Gary Paulsen|Dance, Fire, Professional 
And I don't believe that children are innocent. In fact, no one seriously believes that. Just go to a playground and watch the kids playing in the sandbox! The romantic notion of the sweet child is simply the parents projecting their own wishes.|Michael Haneke|Children, Parents, Child 
Romantic love can be terrifying. We experience another human being as enormously important to us. So there is surrender - not a surrender to the other person so much as to our feeling for the other person. What is the obstacle? The possibility of loss.|Nathaniel Branden|Love, Experience, Loss 
French is the language that turns dirt into romance.|Stephen King|Language, Romance, Dirt 
I think I meant that, given the circumstances of my childhood, I had the illusion that it's easier to be alone.

You know, I was raised on the idea of the ramblin' man and the loner.|Steve Martin|Alone, Man, Childhood 
Romantic love is painful.|will.i.am|Love, Love Is, Painful

What I'd really like to write is a romantic comedy. This is my favorite kind of movie. I feel almost embarrassed revealing this, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years that saying you like romantic comedies is essentially an admission of mild stupidity.|Mindy Kaling|Past, Stupidity, Saying 
I do not like to work with patients who are in love. Perhaps it is because of envy - I, too, crave enchantment. Perhaps it is because love and psychotherapy are fundamentally incompatible. The good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection.|Irvin D. Yalom|Love, Work, Good 
I am a romantic fool, no doubt about that.|Alex Turner|I Am, Fool, Doubt 
A boy is holding a girl so very tight in his arms tonight.|Edward VIII|Girl, Boy, Arms 
Romantic love is mental illness. But it's a pleasurable one. It's a drug. It distorts reality, and that's the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw.|Fran Lebowitz|Love, Love Is, Reality 
Romance is everything.|Gertrude Stein|Everything, Romance 
What is a kiss? Why this, as some approve: The sure, sweet cement, glue, and lime of love.|Robert Herrick|Love, Kiss, Sweet

I will always be the hopeless romantic, more often pathetic than heroic.|Chris Lowell|Hopeless, Will, Always 
Being black, Latino, or Asian is not a genre. Romantic comedies, thrillers, action - those are genres. I think there's a lot of people who want to have the conversation. I don't think people are afraid of it, I just think it's the time to have that conversation. Race is not a genre.|Mara Brock Akil|Time, Action, Conversation 
Normally, things are viewed in these little segmented boxes. There's classical, and then there's jazz; romantic, and then there's baroque. I find that very dissatisfying.

They're just using birth control.|Jen Kirkman|Friends, Beach, Control 
I had written many things as a journalist, but I had no idea if I could write something scary or romantic or touching that wasn't me writing about someone else's life story. It was really exciting to try.|Jeff Giles|Life, Writing, Me 
Classical, Romantic, and Baroque music, that's what I really like.|Joan Armatrading|Music, Like, Baroque

If a June night could talk, it would probably boast it invented romance.|Bernard Williams|Night, Talk, June

The state of New Jersey is really two places - terrible cities and wonderful suburbs.

I don't make romantic films. I make films about human relationships.|Yash Chopra|Relationships, Human

I'm a hopeless romantic and passionate person when it comes to love.|Jennifer Lopez|Love, Passionate, Person

I used to be a hopeless romantic - I fell in love with everyone I went out with.|Jeremy London|Love, Everyone, Hopeless

Any romantic feelings for a 12-year-old are like entering into a fantasy world.|Wes Anderson|World, Feelings, Fantasy

I guess I'm a bit of a romantic.|Felicity Jones|Bit, Guess 
I get some of my ideas from watching my three daughters, but most of them come from my own memories of growing up.

Those were the elements that made a story satisfying to me.|Francine Pascal|Love, Memories, Truth 
If it's a romantic holiday, the only thing I need is my wife. We love quiet and calm places where we can't be disturbed. Neither of us likes being in busy places; we would much rather stay in our hotel room and enjoy each other's company.|Jean Reno|Love, Wife, Busy 
I've seen plays that are, objectively, total messes that move me in ways that their tidier brethren do not. That's the romantic mystery of great theater. Translating this ineffability into printable prose is a challenge that can never be fully met.|Ben Brantley|Great, Challenge, Mystery 
I have a romantic conception of the writer's life, and the sort of writer's life that I admire is probably a childless life, possibly a marriageless life, certainly a travelling life - I'm in awe of how much D.H. Lawrence managed to get around. But that's never been something I'm capable of doing.|Rachel Cusk|Life, Doing, Admire 
I was pleasantly disappointed on entering Bohemia. Instead of a dull, uninteresting country, as I expected, it is a land full of the most lovely scenery.

I don't want to be typecast as a heroine who does a certain kind of cinema, which is why I experiment with the types of films that I do.

A shiny ring isn't romantic to me. I think thought and love into what you do for the person you're in love with - that's romance.|Sasha Grey|Love, Thought, Me 
Surrealism was necessary - essential, even - in the 1920s to bridge the gap between rationalism and the subconscious. It started something important. But by the early '60s, it had become petit-bourgeois; it was too intellectual and romantic, and had ground to a halt. It had become respectable.|Alejandro Jodorowsky|Bridge, Early, Intellectual 
Vampires have become tragic or romantic figures. Vampire are largely seduction tales. They're no longer the scary creature in the dark.|Stephen Graham Jones|Dark, Vampire, Scary 
I think the first time I tried to write a romantic song, it was just horrendously embarrassing. I remember thinking, 'Okay, I'm not going to do that anymore.' I think that sort of embarrassed me for the next 10 years.|Tobias Jesso, Jr.|Time, Thinking, Me

I'm very romantic and of course I want to be in love.|Emma Watson|Love, Want, Course 
I admit I do have some drawbacks and limitations as a candidate. Although I am a professional comedian, some of my critics maintain that this is not enough.

I find 'Fatal Attraction' really romantic. I really like the seduction. Almost every time I see it, I'm surprised when it goes dark. I know that's the claim to fame, but I key into how genuinely romantic it is.|Shane Carruth|Time, Dark, Know

When I was 18, I thought that, to be a romantic, you couldn't live past 30.|David Bowie|Past, Thought, Live

To write a novel is to embark on a quest that is very romantic. People have visions, and the next step is to execute them. That's a very romantic project. Like Edvard Munch's strange dreamlike canvases where people are stylized, like 'The Scream.' Munch must have had that vision in a dream, he never saw it.|Joyce Carol Oates|Vision, Step, People 
I absolutely love Ireland. It's one of the most beautiful places on Earth, and I have strong ties here.

Personally, I find it romantic not to be with someone all the time; you don't get used to someone or take them for granted.|Monica Bellucci|Time, You, Find

You think, 'Musicals, they must always be romantic' - You'd be surprised how few of them historically have ever been romantic.|Harold Prince|Think, You, Always

I don't feel like a romantic lead I guess I feel more like a character actor. |Matthew Macfadyen|Character, Actor, Lead 
Some have called we rock and roll performers who never retire 'troubadours.' I enjoy this misnomer immensely. While there are many differences between me and my distant predecessors in L'Occitane, I do believe there is a lineage that connects us of the last 70 years with those romantic singers of the High Middle Ages.|Frank Black|Believe, Rock And Roll, Me 
I was also the romantic lead in The Boston Strangler - I was the only one that lived to tell the story - so I called myself the romantic lead.|Sally Kellerman|Myself, Story, Lead 
Romantic art deals with the exception and with the individual. Good people, belonging as they do to the normal, and so, commonplace type, are artistically uninteresting.|Oscar Wilde|Art, Good, Good People 
They are just really stupid people in Hollywood. You write them a script, and they say they love it, they absolutely love it. Then they say, 'But doesn't it need a small dog, and an Eskimo, and shouldn't it be set in New Guinea?' And you say, 'But it is a sophisticated romantic comedy set in Paris.'|P. J. O'Rourke|Love, Dog, Stupid 
Kabul is a walled city, which sounds romantic except the walls are pre-cast reinforced concrete blast barriers, 10 feet tall and 15 feet long and moved into place with cranes.

It is possible for a woman to be a romantic, but also to be single and to be happy.|Taylor Swift|Happy, Woman, Be Happy 
I love Indian, Italian and Mexican food. And if it's a romantic type of thing, I like a good French restaurant.|Dolly Parton|Love, Food, Good 
Young people have this almost romantic attachment to civil rights, liberties, emancipating people from oppression, etc. The idea that such oppression exists in this country offends me, but it's able to be pushed and sold because education in this country is so woefully incompetent and inept.|Rush Limbaugh|Education, Me, People 
I love romantic poetry.|Richard Dawkins|Love, Poetry, I Love 
Like almost everything else from the West, the Romantic Revolution arrived late in Russia.|Tom Stoppard|Revolution, Late, Everything 
I think I give the impression of being a romantic, and I think inside I'm quite severe. But some might say they had the opposite impression of me.|Tom Stoppard|Me, Think, Say 
As far as the lack of hits goes, I think perhaps it's because I've played a lot of different roles and have not created a persona that the public can latch on to. I have played everything from psychopathic killers to romantic leading men, and in picking such diverse roles I have avoided typecasting.|Jeff Bridges|Men, Think, Different 
When I was sixteen, I was an absolutely romantic guy. I fell in love every week. I mean, I was in love with everybody, but unfortunately, nobody was in love with me.|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu|Love, Week, Me 
I love a good romantic comedy.|Joss Whedon|Love, Good, Comedy 
Even now, there are young actors who want careers as romantic leading men, and the best thing is not to reveal you're gay.|Ian Mckellen|Best, Men, Want 
The huge difference in my lifetime is that you can just go up to somebody and make a pass. You couldn't do that in the 1950s if you were gay. There were secret handshakes, a secret language. There was nowhere you could go to be romantic outside of people's houses.|Ian Mckellen|Language, People, You 
I'm a big movie fan, and I want to make movies in every genre. I want to make my romantic comedy one day.|James Wan|Day, Movies, Want

Romantic comedies are usually about when love works.|Zooey Deschanel|Love, Romantic Comedies 
I'm a romantic, but I'm not a romantic in the traditional sense. I like to romanticize what happens to me. Whatever happens to me - you could quantify it as good or bad - I romanticize it. I think along the lines of 'When that thing happened, it made me who I am.' That kind of thing. It's a different way of being romantic.|Zooey Deschanel|Good, I Am, Me

I've never been a blind romantic.|Sandra Bullock|Blind, Never, Been

I'm fascinated by Comte's clear-eyed analysis of what was wrong with modern society, which is that you've got industrial capitalism on one side and romantic love on the other. Those, along with non-instrumental art, are supposed to get you through the day?|Alain de Botton|Love, Art, Day 
I used to be addicted to 'Reader's Digest' growing up. I would read the stories about love, and I guess that's where I became a hopeless romantic. I draw from that a lot.|Sia|Love, Growing Up, Growing

I think that romance sort of coincides with effort, so you can fall flat on your face, but as long as you're making a great effort, I think it comes off as romantic.

A friend of mine wrote a script, a feminist romantic comedy. She had a feminist scholar consult on it. My friend said, 'Oh, my friend Gillian read it and really loved it.' She goes, 'Gillian Jacobs, you mean: Britta Perry, feminist icon?'|Gillian Jacobs|Friend, Loved, You

When people discuss the 1960s and the great Civil Rights Era, they often speak in romantic terms as if there wasn't immense work put in, and as if there wasn't immense sacrifice that took place.

I will never say never, but I will say never to doing the more typical romantic comedies. You know, unless I'm getting audited and I'm on the street and I desperately need some dough and that's the only thing that I'm getting.|Christian Bale|Doing, Know, You 
In terms of the romantic kind of lead, I just never enjoy those movies very much. Maybe they'll come to interest me more as I get older. I doubt it, but maybe. Romantic comedies tend to be, for me, an oxymoron.|Christian Bale|Me, Enjoy, Doubt 
The only thing I would unequivocally say is that I have never had any interest in romantic comedy I just couldn't do it. I think I'd be terrible.|Christian Bale|Think, Comedy, Say

There has always been a tension in my life between the romantic and the practical. I can't hole myself up in a cabin and write down ideas for the rest of my life. I also need to be able to clean out a dog bite.|Ethan Canin|Life, Dog, Myself 
Everything is just so much more romantic and real when it's yours and it's private.|Dove Cameron|Real, Everything, Just 
I've always considered myself a fairly romantic person. I believe in love and falling in love at a young age.|Mandy Moore|Love, Age, Myself 
I've had fun doing romantic comedies, but I just can't anymore. There's nothing fulfilling creatively, there's nowhere to grow, nothing to learn from it or for yourself. I'd rather just be home with my family or write music until that special project comes my way.|Mandy Moore|Family, Music, Home 
I don't think Hollywood knows what to do with me. I would imagine that when it comes to romantic comedies, my name would be pretty low down on the list.|Gary Oldman|Me, Name, Think 
Kissing scenes are never romantic or sexy. They're actually super technical, like, 'Move your head; you're blocking her light,' or, 'Stop looking like an idiot when you kiss her.'|Will Poulter|Light, Kiss, Looking 
I love stories with love in them. I just prefer those films. Every so often, I come across a film where there's no love story. It doesn't have to be romantic, but there's a lack of love, and I don't get that.|Rachel McAdams|Love, Story, No Love 
There's something really great and romantic about being poor and sleeping on couches.|Ben Affleck|Great, Poor, Sleeping

After Fergie and Prince Andrew honeymooned at Le Touessrok in Mauritius, Bobby, my late husband, and I were first to stay in their suite.

I'm not a romantic.|Jack Kevorkian|Love
I proposed to my wife on Brighton Beach, and she said yes. That's pretty romantic. Even though I forgot to go down on one knee because I was too busy trying to compose the question.|Robert Webb|Beach, Wife, Busy 
I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.|Taylor Lautner|Hope, Flowers, Know 
So many women today have become so focused on their children, they've developed these romantic entanglements with their children's lives, and the husbands are secondary. They're left out. And the romantic focus is on the children.|Ayelet Waldman|Children, Women, Today

I am very romantic. Given a choice, I'd do only romantic films!|Sonam Kapoor|I Am, Choice, Only 
Even actresses that you really admire, like Reese Witherspoon, you think, 'Another romantic comedy?' You see her in something like 'Walk the Line' and think, 'God, you're so great!' And then you think, 'Why is she doing these stupid romantic comedies?' But of course, it's for money and status.|Gwyneth Paltrow|Money, Great, God 
I had these kind of unrealistic expectations that were fueled by romantic comedies, and it has both helped me and hurt me in many ways. It helped me because, in general, they've made me hopeful. I just figure things will eventually work out for me. But nobody is like any Tom Hanks character. Nobody is Hugh Grant. No one is Meg Ryan!|Mindy Kaling|Work, Character, Hurt 
I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which the world operates according to different rules than my regular human world.|Mindy Kaling|World, Rules, Human 
I have such a rich fantasy life, I can't help it. I do make up a lot of romantic stories in my head.|Mindy Kaling|Life, Help, Rich 
Woody Allen is really the ultimate. I love that he believed in himself enough to do what he did. And I have that same feeling - that there's nobody that looks like me in movies, nobody would cast me as a romantic lead, but I want to do it and I feel confident that I can.|Mindy Kaling|Love, Me, Want 
When men hear women want a commitment, they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship, but that's not it. It's a commitment to not floating around anymore. I want a guy who is entrenched in his own life. Entrenched is awesome.|Mindy Kaling|Life, Relationship, Women 
On 'The Office,' so much of the show is about disguising your true feelings and your romantic feelings because it was a mock documentary.|Mindy Kaling|True, Feelings, Office 
Neutrinos alone, among all the known particles, have ethereal properties that are striking and romantic enough both to have inspired a poem by John Updike and to have sent teams of scientists deep underground for 50 years to build huge science-fiction-like contraptions to unravel their mysteries.|Lawrence M. Krauss|Deep, Alone, Build 
The most conventional romantic trope of all is that you put lovers under extreme pressure, where they have to make decisions that illuminate aspects of that bond.|Lenny Abrahamson|Decisions, Pressure, You 
I am very romantic. In fact, I just renewed my vows... although it was with another woman.|Kevin Nealon|I Am, Woman, Fact

My home is attached to a study - in fact, my home is my study, and I have a little room to sleep in. I need to write looking onto the street or a landscape. Looking at reality from some distance gives me romantic visions.|Orhan Pamuk|Home, Sleep, Reality 
My husband, Sal, and I put date nights on the calendar once a week. I know that doesn't sound romantic, but otherwise it won't get done.|Sherri Shepherd|Week, Husband, Know 
I think when romantic comedies are done well, it's a great genre. 'When Harry Met Sally' is kind of a benchmark for me, but I'm very happy to admit that I love 'Pretty Woman.' I do! It's a great film, and so is 'Sixteen Candles.' I was a big John Hughes fan - still am. I have moments where I have to watch a Hughes film.|Jamie Dornan|Love, Happy, Great

I'm a romantic guy.|Fred Durst|Guy

What Romantic terminology called genius or talent or inspiration is nothing other than finding the right road empirically, following one's nose, taking shortcuts.|Italo Calvino|Road, Talent, Genius 
I broke my nose in gym when a ball hit me. I took a girl to her debutante ball the next week wearing a tux and a big, honking bandage. Not the romantic night she had in mind.|Wentworth Miller|Girl, Mind, Night 
I'm such a romantic at heart.|Morten Tyldum|Heart

Sepia in particular tends to make everything look a bit romantic and almost sentimental, hence the fact that it remains such a popular choice for wedding photographs.|Martin Parr|Wedding, Choice, Look 
Essentially, I spent most of my childhood with my mother and my older sister, and I suppose I had rather a romantic vision of how things might be if there were men around; I saw myself in a country house with six children and a garden. That has never been achieved - and I still regret it.|Claire Tomalin|Children, Sister, Mother 
When I first started drawing the earliest incarnation of 'Optic Nerve,' I hadn't even been on a date; I hadn't had a romantic relationship of any kind yet, so in a way, I was almost writing science fiction.|Adrian Tomine|Relationship, Science

Marriage is not simply a romantic union between two people it's also a political and economic contract of the highest order. |Elizabeth Gilbert|Marriage, Political, People 
You could argue that 'Sweeney Todd' was romantic, if you looked closely at it, but it didn't impart that to its audiences. But it's large, and it's melodramatic, and it's a style I like to work in periodically.|Harold Prince|Work, Style, You 
'Natural Born Killers' is really a misunderstood romantic comedy.|Woody Harrelson|Born, Misunderstood, Comedy 
The other two things are... well, I had a huge appetite for old black and white movies on BBC 2. At the weekends they used to run matinees, and the more romantic the better.|Ewan McGregor|Black And White, Black 
I wouldn't feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy - I'd be bored to death.|Joaquin Phoenix|Day, Death, Every Day

I could never understand, when I watch romantic comedies, the notion that for some reason, unattractive or heavy people don't fall in love. If they do, it's in some odd, kooky, roundabout way - and it's not. It's exactly the same.|James Corden|Love, People, Fall 
I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, believe it or not.|Kate Hudson|Believe, Big, Fan

Remember, beneath every cynic there lies a romantic, and probably an injured one.|Glenn Beck|Remember, Cynic, Every 
I feel about romance the same way I do about a vocation: it's a calling. You have an inner intuition, an inner 'yes.' I don't know if it's destined or not, but certainly I couldn't imagine being the person I am today without the romantic experiences I've had.|Alden Ehrenreich|Today, I Am, Know 
I don't have a favourite romantic scene, but I enjoy romantic movies like 'Ghost' and 'Music and Lyrics.'|Hansika Motwani|Music, Enjoy, Movies

I always think the most romantic books or films are the ones where the romance doesn't happen, because it makes your heart ache so much watching it.|Natalie Portman|Heart, Think, Always 
Vision is a romantic thing. We have got into 'talent identification'. I am much more interested in passion - finding people who are really excited about doing something.|Sebastian Coe|Passion, Vision, I Am

In grammar school I read 'Act One' by Moss Hart, and being a playwright struck me as the most magical and romantic career anyone could have... But I never did write a play.|Alice McDermott|School, Me, Play 
Right away I think of two books - 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Rebecca' - and of just sinking into them as a young reader. I think they must have appealed not just to my romantic adolescent soul, but I suppose there's also an appealing darkness in both of them.|Alice McDermott|Soul, Darkness, Think 
I am still a hard-core romantic.|Divyanka Tripathi|I Am, Still, Am

I'm a big romantic, traditional, cheesy guy.|Josh Hutcherson|Big, Cheesy, Guy 
Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.|Patti Stanger|Age, Today, I Am 
I've done five films directed by women. I did like it. They had qualities, particularly in the romantic tenderness of scenes. I felt sometimes they were a little bit soft, but maybe they were clever to get the guys working the way they wanted them to.|Jacqueline Bisset|Women, Clever, Working 
My goal on my bucket list is to write a romantic comedy movie.|Lynda Barry|Goal, Comedy, Bucket

Anders Thomas Jensen and I had talked about making a movie which addressed the cancer issue, and we didn't want to make it heavy-handed. We wanted to do something which had a lot of hope in it. And then for some reason we came up with a romantic comedy.|Susanne Bier|Hope, Want, Cancer

There's something very romantic about self-destruction and sabotaging your life, and taking a hammer to it.|Gerard Way|Life, Hammer, Something

Movies are romantic fantasies.|Ira Sachs|Movies, Fantasies 
After a life deprived of everything from romantic love to the choice of when to wake up in the morning, after 29 years without the ability to have a career or even to be alone at toilet, the Bijani sisters are not symbols but women who have had to live a shared life of constant, quotidian sacrifice.|Darin Strauss|Love, Life, Women 
I'm not the most romantic guy, although I do try.|Seth Rogen|Try, Guy, Most

My wife was the first romantic partner who understood both American and native parts of me - not so much the positive stuff, but the damage.|Sherman Alexie|Positive, American, Wife 
Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I've done some movies because I would regret them if I didn't, but other projects I've done because they've scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.|Ginnifer Goodwin|Time, Future, Child 
I've always been sort of addicted to genre-jumping. I've never been in the mood to do the same thing I did last time. Hence, me going from 'Big Love' to romantic comedy, to period film... I can't sit still.|Ginnifer Goodwin|Love, Time, Me 
I could go my whole life and say, 'I'm not going to do anything with a love triangle,' but whenever you have a romance, there has to be some obstacle, and even the dumbest romantic comedies have a love triangle or something.|Catherine Hardwicke|Love, Life, You 
German accents and Hassidic accents aren't that romantic. They're more harsh. Although Hebrew, when spoken by certain people, sounds beautiful. There's this beautiful woman I know who speaks Hebrew, and when she speaks, it's so attractive. Maybe it's who's speaking it.|Janeane Garofalo|Beautiful, Beautiful Woman

The romantic embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer.|Havelock Ellis|Music, Prayer, Embrace 
I have a romantic side.|Curtis Jackson|Side 
I would have loved to do 'Alice in Wonderland.' Being a 'Bond' girl would always be fun. We had a lot of action in 'Eclipse' and I'd definitely like to continue down the action road. I want to do a romantic period piece, but those are really hard to get made because they're very expensive and there's not a huge demographic.|Ashley Greene|Road, Girl, Fun 
I would have loved to do romantic comedies. That's what I think I would be best at.|Rene Russo|Best, Loved, Think

When I was about 14 I remember thinking when it came to proposing to my future girlfriend, I'd make a CD with all her favourite songs and a message that said, 'Will you marry me?' Shows you what a romantic I was. No one listens to CDs any more. It's all about iTunes.|Tinie Tempah|Future, Thinking, Me 
The Romantic poets were the prototype ramblers, and I've often found myself following in their footsteps - although perhaps not all of their footsteps since a typical walk for Samuel T. Coleridge might last two days and cover 145km.|Arthur Smith|Myself, Walk, Two 
I lived by the candlelight for two years because I couldn't afford power. It was nice and romantic at the time, but if you can't afford power you're pretty broke. You endure it.|Jeremy Renner|Time, Power, Nice

I would love to do a romantic comedy - a good one.|Stephanie Sigman|Love, Good, Comedy 
I think opera has gained a kind of glamorous appeal. It's a live performance that aligns all of the arts, and when it is represented in the media, in film in particular, it is presented as something that is really a special event, whether it's a great date or something that's just hugely romantic.|Renee Fleming|Great, Performance, Media 
It's good to be able to be a leading lady, to be a romantic lead, to play opposite people who are talented, and charismatic and stuff.|Heather Graham|Good, People, Play 
Kim Kardashian's marriage to Kris Humphries famously lasted 72 days, and was reported in the tabloids as being all about the big bucks paid by magazines for the bridal photos: it is a spectacle of a bride-to-be as entrepreneur, not as romantic heroine; the groom, in this scenario, is nothing but a prop.|Naomi Wolf|Marriage, Entrepreneur 
I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time, but it's not part of a sensible way of living. It's a heroic path and it generally ends dangerously.|Jane Campion|Time, Path, Short 
It's been such a deep and amazing journey for me, getting close to John Keats, and also I love Shelley and Byron. I mean, the thing about the Romantic poets is that they've got the epitaph of romantic posthumously. They all died really young, and Keats, the youngest of them all.|Jane Campion|Love, Journey, Deep 
There is a romantic, often misguided, misconception among the British that life in France is akin to life in Paradise.|Janine di Giovanni|Life, Paradise, British 
I'm a hopeless 19th-century romantic.|John Banville|Hopeless 
People expect me to be dark and gloomy, then write that I'm a jolly chap, and after all, that is what I am. I think it's a case of an absolute romantic naivety that there should be a parallel between the work and the artist.|Michael Haneke|Work, I Am, Artist 
I'm not a social singer. But if one can take a social message via the romantic, that's a strong statement.|Luis Fonsi|Strong, Message, Social

Usually, in romantic comedies, you end up sacrificing a great deal of the complexity - you know, just two attractive people and a good soundtrack.|Timothy Olyphant|Good, Great, People 
'Romeo And Juliet' is the classic love story. When two lovers are separated and trying to get back to one another, that's fiercely romantic and something you become glued to.|Saoirse Ronan|Love, Story, You 
I have nothing against romance. I believe that we must hold on to the right to dream and to be romantic. But an Indian village is not something that I would romanticize that easily.|Arundhati Roy|Believe, Dream, I Believe 
Love alone could waken love.|Pearl S. Buck|Love, Alone, Could 
It was a romantic dream to be a writer. It seemed like a calling.|Bobbie Ann Mason|Dream, Like, Writer 
I'm very romantic, I'm extremely romantic. I date my wife.|Alice Cooper|Wife, Date, Very 
When I started, there was something almost romantic about the notion of paparazzi. I mean, it wasn't. They were still chasing you down the road. But that guy had to put film in his camera and work out whether it was worth pressing the button to take the shot, otherwise he's got to stop and change the film. So it was like this age of innocence.|Kylie Minogue|Work, Change, Age 
I sang everything - R&B slow jams, Spanish slow jams, romantic reggaeton - and I really didn't care which I got signed for.|Prince Royce|Slow, Care, Everything 
I feel like I've done a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies.|Kate Beckinsale|Done, Feel, Like 
When I was pregnant, I had the romantic idea that after the baby was born I would not only take up reading in earnest again, but also write a novel while my daughter slept in her Moses basket. Of course, I barely had time to keep up with my magazines until she started sleeping properly.|Kate Beckinsale|Time, Daughter, Reading 
I've heard stories about movies that are really maybe difficult and really dramatic and good, but they are being sold as romantic comedies. All it's going to do is just... that's hurting the work, because that just makes it impossible for anyone to see it correctly.|Shane Carruth|Work, Good, Impossible 
The only thing I can ever do is make a film that I can respond to. I could not make a romantic comedy for college girls. I wouldn't know how that works.|Shane Carruth|College, Know, Comedy 
Romantic relationships are the least interesting thing for me to write about. I'm 45, and that's not the most interesting thing in my life anymore.|Kelly Sue DeConnick|Life, Me, Relationships 
I think of OkCupid as an online bar; a place where singles can go, have fun with each other and in the process hopefully meet new people, some of whom might turn into a romantic relationship.|Sam Yagan|Relationship, Fun, People 
Judy Garland was a different type of entertainer. She was a dancer, a singer, and an incurable romantic.|Mickey Rooney|She, Singer, Different

I would love to play the lead in a big romantic comedy. That's definitely a dream of mine.|Rosamund Pike|Love, Dream, Play 
Lidia Bastianich, sorry, but kind of boring. I mean, I love Lidia, but you can fall asleep watching her. And Mario Batali? I love Mario to death... but he's not romantic or sensual. Those are the things I bring to the table.|Giada De Laurentiis|Love, Death, Sorry 
I've never felt that I had to take a role in one of those mediocre but hugely budgeted romantic comedies because I want to wear beautiful dresses and have people think I'm pretty and that I get the guy.|Minnie Driver|Beautiful, People, Want

I'm very romantic.|Carmen Electra|Very

I happen to know there is nothing sexy or romantic about love scenes. They are just awful to do.|Keeley Hawes|Love, Sexy, Know

Back in the mid '90s, I went to a film festival, and they were airing 'Central Park West' at the same time as this cute little romantic comedy movie called 'French Exit,' and I got to go from one theater where I was goofy, falling over myself, to this kind of evil vixen kind of character.|Madchen Amick|Time, Myself, Evil 
There's something about marriage that is not as intensely romantic or interesting as a couple's first meeting.|John Sandford|Marriage, Meeting 
I like all types of women. I accept them as they are when they come into my life... But I'm not a romantic. I'm just up-front. I like to be a part of something real, not make-believe. I tell women to tell me the truth, to just lay it out. Let me be the judge and decide if I want you around or not. Let me have my choice.|Nayvadius Cash|Life, Women, Truth 
I am very lucky. I have known wonderful romantic love in my life but to actually see this little creature and find him to be the most beautiful creature in the world. I know all mothers and fathers feel that way.|Anne-Marie Duff|Love, Life, Beautiful 
I can't remember a time when I didn't want to be a reporter. I don't know where I got the idea that it was a romantic calling.|Charles Kuralt|Time, Want, Remember

I'm a romantic.|Tom Cruise|Love
I'm not really a believer in romantic, happily-ever-after love stories.|Richard LaGravenese|Love, Stories, Believer

I'm a hopeless romantic.|Lance Bass|Hopeless 
Cooking is always very romantic!|Matthew Morrison|Cooking, Always, Very

If I can be my crazy, wild self in front of a person, and he still likes me, that's romantic.|Preity Zinta|Self, Crazy, Me 
Wine writers have been around for almost as long as there has been wine, but in the past, generally speaking, most wine writing was uncritical and emphasized wine as a romantic, historic beverage. Criticism and comparative tastings were eschewed for fear of offending the trade, which most writers depended upon for survival.|Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Fear, Writing, Past 
I'm probably the furthest from being romantic that you've ever seen I'm not even close to being romantic in any way until I have to be. |Brian McKnight|Way, You, Being 
For the longest time, I didn't even want to admit I was serious about music. Before the Shins, I would tell myself, 'Oh, I'm going to figure something out someday.' I had this romantic vision of being this old dude maybe making guitars or something.|James Mercer|Music, Time, Myself 
If I can do a romantic comedy with women, that's Everest to me.|Joe Carnahan|Women, Me, Comedy

The city of Oia is the most magnificently romantic place I've ever been.|Lisa Ling|City, Place, Most 
I don't want to be Mr. Romantic Leading Man. I don't want to be the Dance Dude. I don't want to be the Action Guy. If I had to do any one of those all my life, it'd drive me crazy.|Patrick Swayze|Life, Dance, Man 
I'm the first one who sees every romantic comedy in theaters.|Elizabeth Olsen|Comedy, First, Every 
My music is bejewelled, it's colourful, it's romantic, it shines.|Carly Rae Jepsen|Music, Shines

I'm still a bit of a romantic and an idealist and hopelessly naive.|Brit Marling|Naive, Idealist, Still 
Well, there's just some universal truths in a way that I've just observed to be true. You read Voltaire. You read modern literature. Anywhere you go, there's these observations about romantic love and what it does people, and these rotten feelings that rarely are people meaning to do that to each other.|Feist|Love, People, Meaning 
My personal style changes wherever I am. When I'm in Ibiza, I'm a bit girlier because there's an opportunity to be more romantic and dress up for the beach scene. Whereas in New York, I tend to go for suiting and tailoring that almost feels like weaponry for the city - but I think I'm quite playful no matter what.|Jade Jagger|Opportunity, I Am, Changes 
We watch a romantic comedy because we want to cry, say, or an action movie so we can participate in heroics. Horror's different. It can hit you with a moment of revulsion so hard you might want to erase the last five minutes of your life, please.|Stephen Graham Jones|Life, Action, Moment 
My mom had this romantic notion of her children playing classical music. The idea is you learn it when you're still learning language. It's using the same part of the brain.|Andrew Bird|Music, Learning, Children 
I don't want to, in any way, characterize a race or a people or get accused of racial profiling, but the Irish, as lyrical and romantic as they can be in their poetry, they can be every bit as repressed in their personal relations.|Stephen Lang|Poetry, People, Want 
When you have kids and get older, it goes beyond flowers and chocolate. It's about waking up with a baby, letting her sleep in, and making a coffee for her when she wakes up. To me, being romantic is putting someone else first and thinking about what makes them happy.|James Marsden|Happy, Coffee, Flowers 
My sister's journal was the romantic one with boys, and mine was talking about my rock tumbler. We were so different and so similar.|Paula Pell|Sister, Rock, Different

I've flown across America, I've scaled fences, I've stood under windows and gone out of my way hundreds of times. I'm a hopeless romantic. There's no hope for me.|Joel Madden|Hope, America, Me 
In mainstream romantic comedies, I'm usually tearing my hair out. It's just a devastatingly difficult genre for me.|Carter Burwell|Hair, Me, Difficult

It was a time after 'Lady Sings the Blues' and 'Mahogany' and all those romantic movies: I became this romantic figure on the street in a very special way.|Billy Dee Williams|Time, Movies, Blues 
I did something that no brown-skinned man in the movie industry ever did. I made a brown-skinned man look very romantic - a matinee idol.

Mind you, Roman Holiday - which is kind of a romantic comedy - is one of my favorite films, and I think Audrey Hepburn is absolutely phenomenal in that movie.|Ellen Page|Holiday, Mind, Think 
I've always loved the language of flowers. I discovered Kate Greenaway's 'Language of Flowers' in a used bookstore when I was 16 and couldn't believe it was such a well-kept secret. How could something so beautiful and romantic be virtually unknown?|Vanessa Diffenbaugh|Beautiful, Flowers, Believe 
The whole romantic part of my life was a wipeout. I didn't even own a belt.|Paul Lynde|Life, My Life, Part 
More generally, I made an effort to leave out things that weren't relevant to the main narrative themes of the book, namely that there were two sides to Steve Jobs: the romantic, poetic, countercultural rebel on one side, and the serious businessperson on the other.|Walter Isaacson|Book, Effort, Rebel 
I'm a really huge fan of the old romantic comedies from the '30s and '40s... Huge fan. I love all that stuff.|Thomas Jane|Love, Old, Fan 
I usually decide if I'm going to do a movie based on if I like the script or not. I thought 'Pulling Strings' had every single element that a classic romantic comedy needs to be a success. It's very well written. The cast was amazing. It was a decision I made based on the power of the script.|Jaime Camil|Success, Power, Decision 
Perhaps I've been perceived more as a romantic comedy actor, but overall, I enjoy acting in any shape or form.|Jaime Camil|Enjoy, Acting, Comedy

I try to do romantic gestures all the time.|Armie Hammer|Time, Try, Gestures 
In a romantic comedy, it's usually a good idea to have people who can't stand the fact that they are attracted to each other.|Amanda Peet|Good, People, Stand 
I don't live with people, that's why my relationships last. I'm not romantic. Even when I was a teenager if somebody asked if they could hold my hand I'd say, - no, it's not heavy, I can hold it myself, thank you'.|Paul O'Grady|Myself, Thank You, People 
I did a film called 'Puccini for Beginners,' which was a romantic comedy, and I always wanted to do more, but I kept doing drama.|Elizabeth Reaser|Doing, Comedy, Drama

I'm probably a bit romantic about it, but I think we humans miss having contact with fire. We need it.|Jamie Oliver|Fire, Think, Need

To be a lone filmmaker thousands of miles from home with nobody believing in me, that seems romantic.|Doug Liman|Home, Me, Believing 
A good romantic comedy is my favorite movie to watch.|Nicholas Stoller|Good, Favorite, Comedy 
I think the best romantic comedies are hard funny - no soft jokes, but ones that make you, like, guffaw. I also think that they have to make you feel good, ideally, and make you feel warm inside at the end.|Nicholas Stoller|Funny, Good, Best 
I don't like high concept movies very much, and the kind of scripts that I would occasionally get offered tended to be really high concept comedies or romantic comedies. I just don't like it. I like much more realistic movies with actual psychology and behavior in them.|Greg Mottola|Behavior, Movies, Kind 
My dad is Scottish, and he read in the newspaper about the plight of the Scottish Freshwater Mussel, which is a real thing - like, a very real, serious conservation issue. And he's a writer, and he was going to do a film about a Glaswegian gangster, and then I stole the idea and turned it into a romantic comedy.|Talulah Riley|Gangster, Newspaper, Comedy 
For a romantic comedy to be three hours long, that's longer than most marriages.|David Fincher|Long, Comedy, Three

I love being one half of a romantic couple.|Julianna Margulies|Love, Half, Being 
I'm a horrible romantic!|Jamie Campbell Bower|Horrible 
I'm really not a TV junkie... OK, I kind of am a TV junkie, but I'm much more of a movie junkie - my junk food is romantic comedies I've seen a million times.|Alison Brie|Food, Kind, Junk Food 
I don't think I'll ever escape the fact that I don't belong anywhere in particular. I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.|Hugo Weaving|Reality, Escape, Think 
I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.|Hugo Weaving|Reality, Country, Back 
With female-oriented movies, unless it's something like 'Bridesmaids' or a romantic comedy, you've got to really worry about your opening weekend. And I'm always telling stories about women, not younger women, and it's just a much tougher audience to get to the movie theater.|Callie Khouri|Women, Worry, Movies 
I'm more likely to give you a cuddle than a punch in the face. I have a soft side, especially with my girlfriend. I send her flowers and use my culinary skills to pull off romantic meals. I do great Thai dishes.|Jai Courtney|Great, Flowers, You 
America to me is so varied and exciting. I always feel nostalgia for the place I'm not in, and then I get there and find myself in a traffic jam going into the Lincoln Tunnel, and I think, 'God, why was I romanticizing this part of the country?' I think it has to do with the romantic, unrealistic temperament.|Ian Frazier|Myself, God, America 
I'd like to classify my life as a romantic comedy. Unfortunately I feel it's probably more like a TV reality show.|Uma Thurman|Life, Reality, My Life 
I always like to read something romantic about the place I'm visiting.|Anouska Hempel|Place, Always, Like 
When I'm with the wife, and we're having a romantic night, I occasionally think about a glass of red wine, but I'll order a sparkling water. I'd like the wine, but it wouldn't end with one glass, so I don't even go there.|Dave Gahan|Water, Wife, Red

When you're playing a romantic version of a real person, you're playing a version of the truth.|Andrea Riseborough|Truth, You, Person 
I wouldn't treat a romantic scene any differently than any other scene. I would really say the biggest preparation was chewing gum and breath mints! For a kissing scene, it's all about the breath mints!|Alice Englert|Preparation, Treat, Say 
I seem to be drawn to the really romantic songs.|Vonda Shepard|Seem, Songs, Really 
Love is the driver for all great stories: not just romantic love, but the love of parent for child, for family, for country.|Jojo Moyes|Love, Family, Great 
I don't want to be pigeonholed into doing just romantic comedies. But they're fun, and especially for women, it's nice to go to see them and enjoy that breath of fresh air.|Kristen Bell|Women, Fun, Enjoy 
I think that sometimes, romantic comedies have to be really broad, and that the plot of people falling in and out of love or whatever is not enough. 'Enough Said' had that stuff, but I wanted it to be fun and funny while also grounded in reality.|Nicole Holofcener|Funny, Love, Fun 
Assume everything you put on the Internet can and will be seen not only by the person you're talking about, but your future romantic partners and bosses, too.|Mara Wilson|Future, Internet, You 
Full-blooded romantic love I wouldn't be able to write about.|Alan Bennett|Love, Write, Able 
It kind of sounds pretentious, but a film I find deeply romantic is 'Buffalo '66,' which is a film by Vincent Gallo. It's about how you break down all those barriers and expose yourself and open yourself up to ultimately being hurt.|Jim Sturgess|Yourself, Hurt, You 
I'd always been quite wary of doing a romantic comedy. They all seem the same to me.|Jim Sturgess|Me, Doing, Comedy 
Yeah, romantic comedies are the hardest movies to make. Maybe one works a year.|Dylan McDermott|Movies, Year, Maybe 
I think there are certain tenets set in place for all different types on genres. For thrillers, women usually die first. I can't say exactly why, and it's kind of a bummer... But I also can't explain why the wallflower girl in the romantic comedy always gets the guy in the end. That's just the way those movies go.|Katie Aselton|Women, Girl, End 
I'm not about to talk about what's romantic in my life - I figure if you talk about it once - then that's an open invitation for everyone to dig into your personal life even further.|James Van Der Beek|Life, My Life, You 
Being in the studio is a really romantic time.|Alison Krauss|Time, Being, Studio 
My great-grandfather was in the army in India, and we have photographs of my family there in full Victorian dress. They're incredibly romantic.|Georgina Chapman|Family, Dress, Army

I'd like to be the romantic lead one day, but I've got to grow my hair first.|Vinnie Jones|Day, Hair, Grow

'Not Another Happy Ending' is a romantic comedy starring Karen Gillan and Stanley Weber. It is about these two characters and their relationships.|Henry Ian Cusick|Happy, Ending, Relationships 
I like romantic comedies, as it is a fun and light thing to get involved with.|Henry Ian Cusick|Light, Fun, Like

When you are the lead in a romantic comedy, you have to worry about people really liking you.|Morris Chestnut|Worry, People, You 
I am a big fan of the old Howard Hawks films from the 30s and 40s, I was a big Hepburn and Tracey fan for a while and Woody Allen films that are a very different kind of romantic comedy.|Edward Burns|I Am, Comedy, Kind

The essence of romantic love is that wonderful beginning, after which sadness and impossibility may become the rule.|Anita Brookner|Love, Love Is, Sadness 
I love romantic comedy, but I think you have to have another idea that you're chasing along with romantic comedy.|James L. Brooks|Love, Think, You 
No, actually 'The Host' was totally a palate-cleanser for me. I wanted to do something a little bit different than romantic love. Romantic love is in there, obviously, because I enjoy writing about that and living it a lot.|Stephenie Meyer|Love, Love Is, Writing 
I'm in the mood for another Moonstruck experience, for another romantic comedy.|Norman Jewison|Experience, Mood, Comedy 
Moonstruck... was one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.|Norman Jewison|Best, Picture, Oscar 
And even Moonstruck - for some reason the audience were just in the mood for a very romantic film, because it's one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.|Norman Jewison|Best, Mood, Picture 
New York has got this sort of wonderful romantic idea of the South.|Josh Lucas|New York, Idea, New 
I think the institute of marriage is a noble thing. The idea of a partner for life is incredibly romantic. But now we're living to 100. A hundred years ago people were dying at age 37. Til death do us part was a much different deal.|Debra Messing|Life, Marriage, Age 
It more or less has the shape of a love song, but 'Crescent Moon' reflects more my longing for an ancient romantic context that includes wild animals, fire, danger of death, stellar navigation, and seasonal intuition.|Frank Black|Love, Death, Moon 
I'm not the girl that sits at home on a Saturday night plaiting her girlfriend's hair, drinking tea and watching romantic comedies.|Ricki-Lee Coulter|Home, Girl, Hair 
I need to be more romantic. I do. I know that's something women really appreciate.|Brody Jenner|Women, Appreciate, Know 
'Perfect Sense' is a film about love and catastrophe, which I hope is a powerfully romantic and emotional take on the apocalyptic sub-genre. Its aim is to be a minimalist concept movie - where seismic events occur in simple ways that ask the audience to use their imagination.|David MacKenzie|Love, Hope, Imagination 
I was a huge fan of the bandleader Ray Noble when I was younger. He was one of the biggest musical names of his day and wrote such romantic songs as 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and 'The Touch Of Your Lips.' Wonderful stuff.|June Whitfield|Day, Lips, Wonderful 
You're always close and you never get that big romantic lead.|Patricia Clarkson|You, Never, Lead 
I had a lot of romantic notions about what it would mean to cross Asia by foot.|Rory Stewart|Mean, Foot, Notions 
In some sense, I'm a romantic. I like the idea of organic history and tradition.|Rory Stewart|History, Tradition, Idea 
I was the female lead in a romantic comedy. It's a little indie film that we shot in China called 'America Town,' starring Daniel Henney and Bill Paxton. I actually had to speak Chinese in the film. It was funny because I found out I was doing the film and then a week later, I was in Shanghai.|Eliza Coupe|Funny, America, Speak 
I love Billy Wilder, and I love the way that his films can be very touching and very moving and very romantic, and at the same time there's always a little cynical undertone, there's always something that undercuts things.|David Nicholls|Love, Time, Moving 
It'll be interesting to see if I ever have to play a typical, bland romantic interest. I'm quirky, and playing it kind of straight and bland doesn't interest me a whole lot.|Matt McGorry|Me, Play, See 
I really love the idea of the poetically mad - the character that is imbued with the romantic madness. Like River from 'Firefly' or Drusilla from 'Buffy.' Someone dangerously unhinged, where you're really not sure they're going to be reliable minute-to-minute.|Holly Black|Love, Character, River 
We shouldn't romanticize rejection. There's nothing romantic about rejection. It's horrible.|Marlon James|Nothing, Rejection, Horrible 
A romantic is someone who believes that something is valuable even if it doesn't last. And a non-romantic is someone who says that if something doesn't endure, or can't be logically proved and pinned down, it's worthless.|Sebastian Faulks|Down, Endure, Something 
For me, the romantic comedies I love are the ones that pay homage to the genre, but also find their ways to twist it and tweak it.|Greg Berlanti|Love, Me, Find 
The Southern whites are in many respects a great people. Looked at from a certain point of view, they are picturesque. If one will put oneself in a romantic frame of mind, one can admire their notions of chivalry and bravery and justice.|James Weldon Johnson|Great, Justice, Mind 
I am a romantic, in a literary way, by which I mean the Romantic poets, who thought just because a sensation is fleeting doesn't mean it isn't valuable. If the only criterion of value is whether something lasts, then the whole of human life is a waste of time.|Sebastian Faulks|Life, Time, I Am 
Then I abandoned comics for fine art because I had some romantic vision of being like Vincent Van Gogh Jr.|Bill Griffith|Art, Vision, Fine 
I was commissioned to write some romantic fiction, and I really liked doing those, and they were very instructive in terms of building characters and plots. But it never felt right for me.|Paula Hawkins|Me, Building, Doing 
When I read the script, I liked the script very much and I thought it was a marvelous part for her, because I think it is a change of pace. I mean, we know how wonderful she is in romantic comedy.|Albert Finney|Change, Thought, Know 
I think if you're going to be committed to doing anything, you really have to care about it, and I suppose that is a romantic idea.|Tony Benn|Care, Think, You 
Therapy was the biggest romance of my life.|Dar Williams|Life, My Life, Therapy 
I got a gymnastics scholarship to college, fell in love with my true love of my whole life - who I'm married to now - and he was a virgin too. It was very romantic.|Victoria Jackson|Love, Life, College 
'I Am Number Four' is an action-packed adventure entwined with a romantic story. I play the role of John Smith. John wants to be a normal kid, but he is from a different planet and he has been given this destiny of becoming a warrior.|Alex Pettyfer|Adventure, I Am, Destiny 
I don't want to do romantic roles where I have to lip sync to a song. A role that explores romance on a new level would suit me.|Irrfan Khan|Song, Me, Want 
When you see a bad romantic comedy, you see the script, the director, and the actors trying to create this warmth and this pathos and this feeling that you care about them. That cannot be manufactured - it's either there or it isn't.|Jeff Garlin|Care, Comedy, You 
I love romantic films and love drama. Any film that has romance or romantic element is my comfort.|Rani Mukerji|Love, Comfort, Drama 
I think that baseball as a whole, I am a huge romantic when it comes to the history and the stats and the numbers the stories behind it, so I would consider myself a pretty big fan.|Graham Elliot|History, Myself, Baseball 
Well my biggest dream is to be in a romantic comedy.|Izabella Scorupco|Dream, Comedy, Well 
I've been married before, but I've never had my dream wedding in Vegas. I wanted to do it there because it's casual, quick, not religious and, most of all, very romantic.|Sinead O'Connor|Wedding, Dream, Vegas 
I sail, run dogs, ride horses, play professional poker and tell stories about the stuff I've been through. And I'm still a romantic; I still want Bambi to make it out of the fire.|Gary Paulsen|Fire, Professional, Want 
I'm really a romantic at heart.|Christopher Atkins|Heart, Really 
I was a very romantic, overly dramatic young lady, which served me well as a songwriter. Especially as someone who had to focus on lyrics and melody, because if you're a dramatic and romantic person, lyrics come easy, and you turn every single short-term relationship into the biggest 'Romeo-and-Juliet' story ever.|Jane Wiedlin|Relationship, Focus, Me 
I think as a filmmaker one should make all kinds of films. It is not that one should make only one kind of film. I love to see romantic films; I loved watching 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge,' 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.' If I make such films, I will make it with my yardstick, according to my parameters.|Madhur Bhandarkar|Love, Loved, Think 
I don't need to control anything. Even with romantic partnerships, I don't need to control anyone.|Cass McCombs|Partnerships, Control, Need 
I never sat down and said, 'I'm going to write historical fiction with strong romantic elements.' It was just the way the stories went.|Lauren Willig|Strong, Down, Said 
Say what you will about Queen Eleanor, she was a savvy, quick-witted woman who made her mark on history. And as the founder of the Courts of Love, what better patron monarch could there be for a romantic novelist?|Lauren Willig|Love, History, Woman 
Get this, kids - how a man proposes isn't what makes him romantic. It's how a man purposes to lay down his life that makes him romantic.|Ann Voskamp|Life, Man, Down 
Being a black woman, there's so many different sides of us. We are funny, silly, romantic, professional, smart, and we have good jobs.|Lauren London|Funny, Good, Woman

I watch 'The Notebook.' I love romantic movies. I love romantic comedies.|Romeo Miller|Love, Movies, Watch 
I don't like the way recording to digital sounds. Most of the time, when I'm recording to two-inch tape, I still have a romantic vision of how songs sounded coming out of the radio when I was younger, and how they sounded coming out of my little four-track cassette player.|M. Ward|Time, Vision, Digital 
When I watch a romantic comedy, I feel like they're selling something that doesn't exist. Two beautiful, but extremely unpleasant, people are terrible to each other for an hour, accidentally kiss, then decide to like each other during an extremely vague montage. That isn't how people fall in love.|Rainbow Rowell|Love, Beautiful, Fall 
It's very difficult, I think, especially on two cellphones, to have a romantic conversation.|Rainbow Rowell|Conversation, Think 
Well, we all start thinking we're going to be Romantic rock stars, but then reality hits and you realize no one reads you but other poets.|George Murray|Stars, Thinking, Reality 
I'm sick of playing romantic leads.|John Corbett|Sick, Playing, Leads 
I get a lot of dramas, but I'd like to do a romantic comedy type of movie; that'd be a nice step for me. No more screaming or running or shooting... for one movie where I can just be in love with a boy.|Serinda Swan|Love, Step, Me 
I'm looking forward to sproglets but, as I'm the main breadwinner, I feel I ought to capitalise on my career for a bit longer. Mother keeps telling me I should go and freeze some eggs. Not terribly romantic, is it?|Honeysuckle Weeks|Mother, Looking Forward, Me 
I've written a couple of scripts. Actually, a pilot. I'm not sure I'm allowed to say, but it's a comedy about three young men in New York City, one of whom may or may not be a romantic like me.|Andre Holland|Men, City, Me 
I'm the old-school, letter-writing romantic. I know it's out of style, and not a lot of women go for that these days, but that's what I go for.|Andre Holland|Women, Style, Know 
The romantic appeal of solar sailing has ensured that its advocates consistently come from the worlds of both science fiction and science fact.|Thomas Mallon|Science, Sailing, Solar 
It's the pursuit of love and happiness that is the driving force of the romantic novel.|Susanna Kearsley|Love, Happiness, Driving 
When you say that you write romantic fiction, there are a lot of people who have an image in their mind of the 'bodice ripper.' It's the one term that most romantic fiction writers absolutely hate because it has no bearing on what people are writing.|Susanna Kearsley|Writing, Hate, Mind 
Romantic fiction, in the broader sense, can be any novel that has a love story somewhere in it. It can be a mystery or a historical novel, as long as it has this very strong romantic thread running through it.|Susanna Kearsley|Love, Strong, Mystery 
Yes, I wrote songs. I was becoming kind of an Enrique Iglesias kind of a singer, with those ballads and cheesy romantic things.|Juan Diego Florez|Kind, Singer, Cheesy 
Boys have said in the past that I live my life like a movie. I love all things romantic, like kissing in the rain.|Mollie King|Love, Life, Rain 
I have never been so calculating as to sing some Barry White song to get a girl. But I do think it's very romantic to cook dinner and sit around the piano at night and sing together.|John Stamos|Together, Girl, Night 
Romantic lovers require from each other at least the facade of reason: We desire to be what romantic love makes us appear in the other's eyes. We want to imagine we are deserving of the love we inspire.|Maggie Gallagher|Love, Eyes, Inspire 
Well, I think first it was rare for me to do anything that had any kind of a romantic note to it.|Tim Roth|Me, Think, Kind 
As an actor, I've grown considerably. It's taken me years to get comfortable doing a romantic scene and dancing on stage in front of a live audience. I've really opened up a lot.|Sanjay Dutt|Me, Live, Doing 
I bought a selection of short, romantic fiction novels, studied them, decided that I had found a formula and then wrote a book that I figured was the perfect story. Thank goodness it was rejected.|Louise Brown|Short, Book, Perfect 
As an actor, I've grown considerably. For example, it's taken me years to get comfortable doing a romantic scene and dancing on stage in front of a live audience. I do it a lot better than I ever did. I've really opened up a lot. And I'm glad I have because I'm being appreciated for it.|Sanjay Dutt|Me, Live, Better 
I don't know if it's a romantic comedy but I'm in the beginning of the first of the season of 'The West Wing.' We shot it last year. I don't know. If anyone asks me to be in one, I'll jump on it.|Jason Isaacs|Beginning, Me, Know 
I couldn't write a happy movie or romantic comedy to save my life. Yes, Noel Coward's an idol, but his plays are serious to me. 'Private Lives' and 'Design for Living' both have an edge. Without psychoanalyzing myself, I think I exorcise my demons in my work.|John Logan|Life, Work, Happy 
I'm romantic to the point of embarrassment.|Jesse L. Martin|Embarrassment, Point 
In Romanticism, the main determinant is the mood, the atmosphere. And in that regard, you could also describe Schubert as a Romantic.|Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau|Mood, You, Romanticism 
I don't think any of the early Romantic composers knew how to write for the piano... The music of that era is full of empty theatrical gestures, full of exhibitionism, and it has a worldly, hedonistic quality that simply turns me off.|Glenn Gould|Music, Quality, Me 
I'm a real romantic.|Vanity|Real 
The American is wholeheartedly for love and romance at any cost.|Leslie Caron|Love, American, Cost 
I'm a dreadful romantic. No matter what I go through in life, I want to fall in love with a man.|Rachel Hunter|Love, Life, Man

And I think maybe all women, if they just had a chance, would be romantic and believe in love and not sex. And men believe in sex and not love.|Beatrice Wood|Love, Women, Men 
I'm sorry, but I can't make a movie with the blonde from 'ER' who is starring in every single bad romantic comedy.|Matthew Fox|Sorry, Comedy, Blonde 
The thing you can't let go of is gravity. The reality of gravity in writing. If someone says something really mean in a sitcom, and the next wave isn't a reaction to the reality of that, you start losing relatability. In a lot of romantic comedies, they throw out the rules of life.|Michael Patrick King|Life, Writing, Reality 
The big stars I felt a kinship with were never the romantic leads. It wasn't Steve McQueen or Robert Redford - it was people like Walter Matthau and Anthony Quinn. My big hero was Tommy Cooper.|Alfred Molina|Hero, Stars, People 
It is certainly true that writers take a stance at some variance from organized religion. This has not always been true. But since the romantic movement - and I'm referring now exclusively to poetry - the emphasis has been on the individual imagination defined against, rather than in terms of, any orthodoxy.|Eavan Boland|Religion, Imagination 
I don't want to adhere to any particular image. I have tried to bring in variety to my characters. But then, only a few actors have managed to earn this tag of a romantic hero. Many have aspired to get such a label. So I am not complaining.|Nivin Pauly|Hero, I Am, Want 
I have been doing a lot of romantic movies, so such roles don't excite me much now. I would like to play an out-and-out, really cruel villain once. My character in 'Da Thadiya' had such a streak, but I want a full length villainous role. It is a different kind of excitement.|Nivin Pauly|Character, Me, Want 
All of the songs my grandparents and parents listened to are called boleros - they're all love songs. They're about giving your heart to a person. It's a culture that is so romantic and passionate, and that's something that I'm very proud of. We grew up with nothing, so we just want to live a life full of love.|Camila Cabello|Love, Life, Culture 
I don't want to be romantic, but one of the most important things is to have happy buildings... it's like having a family with a lot of children.|Renzo Piano|Family, Children, Happy 
When I start to write, words have become physical presence. It was to see if I could bring that private world to life that found its first expression through reading. I really dislike the romantic notion of the artist.|John McGahern|Life, Words, Artist 
If I loved all the world as I do you, I shouldn't write books to it: I should only write letters to it, and that would be only a clumsy stage on the way to entire telepathy.|Laurence Housman|World, Loved, You 
I hate to sound like a romantic adolescent, but I believe artists don't generally see art as a career choice; they simply can't overcome their desire to make art, and will live on little income for as long as they have to, before they start to sell their work - or give up and get a paying job.|Charles Saatchi|Work, Art, Hate 
People want to hear about the extremes of human nature. They want things that are larger than their own lives, and more romantic, and not necessarily of their own experiences.|Richard Thompson|Nature, People, Human Nature 
I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss, and I feel like in modern day relationships, and maybe just my own experience, it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together. You're texting. You're wondering what's going on. There's no definitions, there's no labels.|Elizabeth Meriwether|Day, Experience, Together 
Women love romance, but they're not as romantic as men.|George Hamilton|Love, Women, Men 
I went through a stage of writing my cramped hand in tiny books. My two sisters and I did have our Bronte period. My mum is from Yorkshire, and we would go up to the Moors. It tapped into our romantic visions of ourselves.|Rachel Joyce|Writing, Two, Through 
Nobody's life is as romantic as it is in fiction.|Ruth Glick|Life, Nobody, Fiction 
Elizabeth Taylor was an incurable romantic at heart. She never gave up on the notion that a love strong enough to last a lifetime was waiting for her around the next corner.|Teresa Medeiros|Love, Strong, Heart 
I'd love to continue my career in Hollywood - I'd love to do another action film, or a romantic comedy, or horror. I love horror films.|Rain|Love, Action, Comedy 
We travellers are in very hard circumstances. If we say nothing but what has been said before us, we are dull and have observed nothing. If we tell anything new, we are laughed at as fabulous and romantic.|Mary Wortley Montagu|Said, New, Circumstances 
I love to make songs out of some of those shadows - you know, some of the things you lie awake thinking about, social anxieties and romantic insecurities and all that stuff.|Matt Berninger|Love, Thinking, Lie 
A lot of the scripts I read and the characters I get are 'the girl' in romantic films, and I don't know how comfortable I am, or the world is, with me being that.|Mamie Gummer|I Am, Girl, World 
One of the pitfalls of a romantic comedy is that you know how it's going to end.|Jason Segel|End, Know, You 
I never got the opportunity to be romantic or feel romantic with anyone.|Gary Coleman|Opportunity, Feel, Never 
I am a pretty emotional person. Any act of kindness or unkindness moves me. When I see a romantic couple sitting by the beach, it moves me. I don't break down or crack under pressure, but I am just sensitive.|Nimrat Kaur|Kindness, I Am, Beach 
Basically, I'm a romantic.|Pia Zadora|Basically 
I like to see love stories: romantic comedy or romantic drama.|Pia Zadora|Love, Comedy, Drama 
When I was younger, many of my romantic escapades were just a means of simply avoiding being by myself. I was afraid of feeling lonely, afraid I wouldn't know what to say to myself.|Michael Zaslow|Myself, Lonely, Know 
I am a romantic, I admit it.|Keith Jarrett|I Am, Admit, Am 
I'm drawn to the romantic aspect of a character. It's human emotion. It's much more fun to watch. And it's much more fun to play.|Natalie Zea|Character, Fun, Play 
I believe I can even yet remember when I saw the stars for the first time.|Max Muller|Time, Stars, Believe 
'Little Night' has layers of meaning. There's something enchanted about night. All those heavenly bodies, shooting stars, the crescent moon, celestial phenomenon. Owls fly at night, and first kisses happen. Night is romantic. Alternately, darkness hides the worst of human behavior.|Luanne Rice|Stars, Darkness, Moon 
It seemed romantic but also tragic - people would be winning but then lose it all, or crash but fight on, break bones but get back on their bikes and try to finish. Just getting to the end was seen as an achievement in itself.|David Millar|Achievement, Winning, Fight 
Clearly romantic comedy is my franchise genre, I don't mind saying that, it's true. I love doing them and hopefully always will do them.|Meg Ryan|Love, Mind, Saying 
I enjoy doing romantic stories. I've done a lot of them.|Joe Lando|Enjoy, Doing, Done 
I tend to play strong characters and people just assume that I would want to play romantic comedies, which I would love to do, but there are other women that do it so great and they maybe couldn't do what I do, play the kind of characters that I play.|Carrie-Anne Moss|Love, Women, Great

If you want to wear long hair or wear that dress, as long as you're not hurting yourself or anybody else, I say do it. If you want to go out and have a romantic, sexy affair, do it.|Florence Henderson|Hair, Dress, Yourself 
I'm not really a fan of Valentine's Day. I think it can be romantic doing nothing on Valentine's Day. It's more romantic than being given a big bunch of flowers that everyone else is doing.|Gabriella Wilde|Day, Flowers, Think 
The most romantic thing someone did was surprise me at the airport, after being away for 3 months in Los Angeles. You always see people with signs, and you're like, 'Isn't that lovely?' and then you see your own name on one - that isn't a taxi driver's! I was very impressed.|Ophelia Lovibond|Surprise, Me, People 
My husband does so many romantic things for me, it's absurd.|Jennifer Beals|Me, Husband, Things

If we perform the romantic repertoire we need more musicians.|Neville Marriner|Musicians, Need, Repertoire 
My brother has a tendency to get quite lyrical when he writes music; he gets so romantic, it's borderline. I make it slightly more aggressive. I make the round corner a bit sharper.|Josephine de La Baume|Music, Brother, Corner 
There are so many people I know who could be the greatest film-maker but who will never get the chance to make a movie it's all about what somebody is going to make back. There are not a lot of romantic ideas about making movies anymore. |Alexandra Cassavetes|Ideas, People, Greatest 
I think of making a movie in such a romantic way.|Alexandra Cassavetes|Think, Way, I Think 
Romantic Orientalism was fascinated by the color and excitement of a powerful culture, and nearly always approached its subject with love.|Kage Baker|Love, Culture, Powerful 
I do feel like guys feel pressure to be funny with me, which is kind of annoying. It's a turn-off if someone's trying hard to be funny because it feels like they're auditioning for a comedy job or something. It doesn't feel romantic to me. I get so much comedy from my life that, from a guy, I'm more looking for something sweet or romantic.|Chelsea Peretti|Funny, Life, Job 
I'm a hopeless romantic with a dirty mind.|Leelee Sobieski|Mind, Hopeless, Dirty 
My mother was a reader; my father was a reader. Not anything particularly sophisticated. My mother read fat historical or romantic novels; my father liked to read Westerns, Zane Grey, that kind of stuff. Whatever they brought in, I read.|John Edgar Wideman|Father, Mother, Fat 
There are so many different reasons as to why I love riding trains. But I think ultimately it's the romantic feeling of it. There's something about it that just transports me into old films.|Rosario Dawson|Love, Me, Think 
Ever since the romantic comedy-drama 'She's Gotta Have It' antagonized black women and black men in 1986, Spike Lee's films have enjoyed the outrage of various groups.|Lee Siegel|Women, Men, Black 
In urban America, you do not so much meet a romantic partner as inherit the product of someone else's romantic crimes.|Lee Siegel|America, Partner, You 
You're an actor, are you? Well, all that means is: you are irresponsible, irrational, romantic, and incapable of handling an adult emotion or a universal concept without first reducing it to something personal, material, sensational - and probably sexual!|George Herman|Emotion, You, Personal 
I really, really, really want to do a silly romantic comedy where I can just have a crush on the guy, trip over myself, and laugh and be goofy. I just feel like all I do is cry, sob, and fight zombies and the bad guys.|Laurie Holden|Myself, Fight, Laugh 
Before I became a suspense novelist, I wrote romantic suspense as Alicia Scott.|Lisa Gardner|Suspense, Before, Became 
I got a degree in sociology, didn't read much fiction in college, and I was a pretty political, left-wing type of guy. I wanted to do some kind of work in social change and make things better for the poor man, and I was very romantic and passionate about it.|Andre Dubus III|Work, Change, College 
As a young woman, I had been seeking experience, knowledge, truth, the stuff writers need in their work, but when the artist actually kicked in, I came to understand that in this romantic relationship I was not free to be myself, or to find myself, in order to begin the true work I needed to do.|Taiye Selasi|Work, Relationship 
I just - I like the saccharin and the gooeyness of 'Bachelor,' and how just gross and like falsely romantic it is. Whereas, like, the 'Real Housewives' is just raw, and it's just - it's the fights that get me. It's just very uncomfortable for me.|Ken Marino|Me, Real, Bachelor 
I think the only thing that I really haven't done much in, and I haven't felt too attracted to, is romantic comedies.|Marco Beltrami|Done, Think, I Think 
To me, the most romantic gesture is a quiet night with my girl. I like to cook for her. I'm a meat eater and a griller - I do steaks, I do chicken, I do fish. I have a broad palate!|Taylor Kinney|Girl, Night, Me 
I want to be romantic, and songs are a good way to do that.|Tobias Jesso, Jr.|Good, Want, Way 
I just like being as romantic as possible. I thrive off unrequited love. I've been in love in one way or another since I was 14. I go full-on in and get obsessive.|Tobias Jesso, Jr.|Love, Way, Possible 
I've always loved the '40s romantic comedies and the idea of those mistaken identities and lovers' misunderstandings.|Pearl Cleage|Loved, Idea, Lovers 
I really love writing comedy. Writing romantic comedy is even nicer because you get to write about how insane we all act when we're falling in love.|Pearl Cleage|Love, Writing 
I would like to do maybe a smaller romantic comedy.|Linda Fiorentino|Comedy, Like, Maybe 
I got married in Florence, Italy. My husband and I were in love but totally broke, so we eloped and got married in Italy, where he was going on a business trip. We had to pull a guy off the street to be our witness. It was incredibly romantic. Florence is still one of my favorite cities in the world.|Libba Bray|Love, Business, World 
Historically, the French have had a romantic attachment to their bikes.

Jung Yong-hwa and I know so much about each other, I think it would be difficult for us to start a romantic relationship.|Park Shin-hye|Relationship, Start, Know

Hip hop is the strongest form of protest there is, and it doesn't always have to be a violent protest. It can be romantic, also.

The phrase 'off with the crack of the bat', while romantic, is really meaningless, since the outfielder should be in motion long before he hears the sound of the ball meeting the bat.|Joe DiMaggio|Long, Meeting, Motion 
I'm a romantic at heart.|Tyler Farr|Heart 
I'm a romantic. The impressionists have always been my favorites. I like prettiness - beauty, or what I perceive as beauty.|Paul Horn|Beauty, Always, Like 
Although some people think I am a romantic novelist I have always thought of myself as a rather gritty radical historian.|Philippa Gregory|Myself, I Am, People 
If I were sufficiently romantic I suppose I'd have killed myself long ago just to make people talk about me. I haven't even got the conviction to make a successful drunkard.|John Dos Passos|Myself, Successful, Me 
Something like 'Without a Paddle' does really well at the box office and I'm like, 'Oh, here we go.' In 'Without a Paddle' I'm the romantic lead - great! A comedy and that's what America wants. Then it did nothing for me and I went into kind-of a work abyss. I just didn't get another shot.|Matthew Lillard|Work, Great, America 
But other vampire stories? Well, no, I really haven't read too many, and I can't say I'm crazy about romantic vampires anyway - to me the vampire is simply an evil monster.|Brian Lumley|Crazy, Evil, Me

Many people with physical disabilities have romantic lives and good marriages to partners who see past their disabilities and recognize all of the things they can do.|Jeanne Phillips|Good, Past, People 
We 'chicks' have munched our popcorn while romantic comedies became just comedies, and then each female protagonist got recast for Matthew McConaughey or Seth Rogan.|Emma McLaughlin|Popcorn, Just, Female 
I don't like to search too much. I find it is easier when romance finds you.|Michelle Trachtenberg|Search, You, Find 
Romance like a ghost escapes touching; it is always where you are not, not where you are. The interview or conversation was prose at the time, but it is poetry in the memory.|George William Curtis|Time, Memory, Poetry 
My idea of a romantic night is to watch action films.|Corey Hart|Action, Night, Idea 
I love the romance in Kimberly Derting's 'The Body Finder.' 'Cold Kiss' by Amy Garvey is unbelievably touching - and about so much more than just romantic love.|Claudia Gray|Love, Kiss, Body 
I think we've always been fascinated with the idea of the romantic outlaw. John Gotti could be in one instance a charismatic, kind and loving family man, and in another, deadly to his enemies. The opportunity to tell the true story of Gotti with John Travolta is a director's dream.|Joe Johnston|Family, Opportunity, Man 
Words of love, are works of love.|William R. Alger|Love, Words, Works 
Too many women throw themselves into romance because they're afraid of being single, then start making compromises and losing their identity. I won't do that.|Julie Delpy|Women, Identity, Losing 
As a kid I quite fancied the romantic, Bohemian idea of being an artist. I expect I thought I could escape from the difficulties of maths and spelling. Maybe I thought I would avoid the judgement of the establishment.|Peter Wright|Thought, Artist, Escape 
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive.|Billy Strayhorn|Strive, Romance, Who 
Romantic heroes and heroines are a bit different from the sort of people we run into every day.|Leigh Michaels|Day, People, Every Day

The view which regards man as a well, a reservoir full of possibilities, I call the romantic; the one which regards him as a very finite and fixed creature, I call the classical.|T. E. Hulme|Man, View, Possibilities 
Forget romantic fiction, a survey has found that most women would rather read a good book than go shopping, have sex, or sleep.|Janet Street-Porter|Women, Good, Sleep 
Romance is dead - it was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney, homogenized, and sold off piece by piece.|Yeardley Smith|Dead, Off, Hostile 
I think one of the downsides of the sort of obsession with romantic love and personal fulfillment is that the plain fact of the matter is that those feelings don't last for ever and so they better be replaced and reinforced by things that do.|Mary Archer|Love, Better, Think 
I was born with a romantic nature, and I'll carry it to my grave.|Telly Savalas|Nature, Born, Carry 
There are two births: the one when light, First strikes the new awakened sense; The other when two souls unite, And we must count our life from thence, When you loved me and I loved you, Then both of us were born anew.|William Cartwright|Life, Light, Me

Never above you. Never below you. Always beside you.|Walter Winchell|You, Never, Always 
More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts.|Travis Bradberry|Success, Challenge, Boss 
Don't wait to be successful at some future point. Have a successful relationship with the present moment and be fully present in whatever you are doing. That is success.|Eckhart Tolle|Success, Future, Successful 
People change and forget to tell each other.|Lillian Hellman|Change, People 
No one can live without relationship. You may withdraw into the mountains, become a monk, a sannyasi, wander off into the desert by yourself, but you are related. You cannot escape from that absolute fact. You cannot exist in isolation.|Jiddu Krishnamurti|Mountains, Desert, Yourself 
Treasure your relationships, not your possessions.|Anthony J. D'Angelo|Relationships, Treasure 
He who loves 50 people has 50 woes he who loves no one has no woes. |Buddha|People, He, Who 
Relationships are eternal. The 'separation' is another chapter in the relationship. Often, letting go of the old form of the relationship becomes a lesson in pure love much deeper than any would have learned had the couple stayed together.|Marianne Williamson|Love, Together, Letting Go 
Be honest, brutally honest. That is what's going to maintain relationships.|Lauryn Hill|Relationships, Honest, Going 
It's a complicated relationship with a guitar. I love the Bullet, for sure.|Laurent Brancowitz|Love, Guitar, Complicated

My relationship to plants becomes closer and closer. They make me quiet I like to be in their company. |Peter Zumthor|Me, Plants, Company 
Distance is a bad excuse for not having a good relationship with somebody. It's the determination to keep it going or let it fall by the wayside that's the real reason that the relationships continue. |James McAvoy|Good, Determination, Fall 
Every man sees in his relatives, and especially in his cousins, a series of grotesque caricatures of himself.|H. L. Mencken|Man, Cousins, Relatives 
The thing that I think is the most important is taking moments to express your appreciation to your partner. A thank you or a quick kiss can go a long way toward affirming your relationship and commitment to each other. That's not hard to do even when you're juggling insane careers and three kids.|Michael Ian Black|Appreciation, Thank You 
Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast.|Marlene Dietrich|Man, Woman, Breakfast

You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back.|Barbara De Angelis|Loving, You, Back 
Spirituality is not a formula it is not a test. It is a relationship. Spirituality is not about competency it is about intimacy. Spirituality is not about perfection it is about connection.

I believe everyone has a soul mate that they can spend the rest of their life together.|Ryan Lochte|Life, Together, Soul 
We have a relationship with our customer, and that relationship translates into sales.|Richard Hayne|Sales, Customer, Our 
A relationship can give you a gut wrenching feeling sometimes. It's a real emotional ride.|Drake|Ride, Emotional, You 
Everything is expressed through relationship. Colour can exist only through other colours, dimension through other dimensions, position through other positions that oppose them. That is why I regard relationship as the principal thing.|Piet Mondrian|Why, Principal, Colour 
Who cares about the clouds when we're together? Just sing a song and bring the sunny weather.|Dale Evans|Together, Clouds, Weather 
It takes one person to forgive, it takes two people to be reunited.|Lewis B. Smedes|Forgive, People, Person 
Love comes when manipulation stops when you think more about the other person than about his or her reactions to you. When you dare to reveal yourself fully. When you dare to be vulnerable. |Joyce Brothers|Love, Yourself, Think 
You hear about quality time a lot but I really think that quantity time with a person is really what strengthens a relationship. That's when you really get to know somebody. You get to know their strengths and their weaknesses and that brings you closer. That's what 'Time Is Love' is all about.|Josh Turner|Love, Time, Love Is 
Any relationship should have love, and if there is no love, it is better to call off a relationship. People say that love happens only once, but I don't believe in it because for me, if one relationship doesn't work, you should move on and seek love in another relationship. Who knows; you might find love in the second relationship.|Bipasha Basu|Love, Work, Believe 
A people's relationship to their heritage is the same as the relationship of a child to its mother.|John Henrik Clarke|Mother, Child, People 
Our first scene is sort of a reunion between the X-Men characters, which establishes everyone's relationship to one another, sort of like a recap for all those who have forgotten since the last movie.|Shawn Ashmore|Reunion, First, Everyone

Relationships are like traffic lights. And I just have this theory that I can only exist in a relationship if it's a green light.|Taylor Swift|Light, Green, Relationships 
Self-reflection is so healthy.

It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves.

Looking back over the years, I realize the Bible isn't magic, but it is corrective; it isn't an answer book, it is a living book; it isn't a fix-it book, it is relationship book.

I think it's always natural for children to rebel against their parents and establish their own identity. And also, I think parents get invested in, you know, doing the right thing?

It's a great relationship when you can work with the person who you consider to be your soul mate.|Rick Derringer|Work, Great, Soul

People aren't defined by their relationship. The whole point is being true to yourself and not losing yourself in relationships, whether romances or friendships.|Nina Dobrev|Losing, Yourself, People

The thought no longer has you in its grip.|Eckhart Tolle|Memories, Power, Past

I'm not a relationship expert. I'm an expert on manhood.|Steve Harvey|Expert, Manhood

A relationship will be futile if it's based just on physicality. Intellectual stimulation is a must for me.|Arjun Kapoor|Me, Intellectual, Will

Once you lose the honesty in a relationship, I mean, I think you don't have a relationship at all.|Elizabeth Gillies|Honesty, Think, You 
He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression... I cannot see him.

To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children.|Ronan Farrow|Family, Children, Father 
I love Neil Young. And he loves me! We have a great relationship.|Donald Trump|Love, Great, Me 
I think that anyone who lives in New York, who's lived here, who's spent any time here, knows that it's basically a love-hate relationship, you might say.

The love far outweighs the negative.|Spike Lee|Love, Time, World

One of the things about football is, it's a relationship business.|Peyton Manning|Business, Football, Things

A relationship isn't going to make me survive. It's the cherry on top.|Jennifer Aniston|Me, Survive, Cherry

What does it matter how many lovers you have if none of them gives you the universe?|Jacques Lacan|Universe, Matter, You

In 'Hardflip,' you have a relationship where the father and son haven't seen each other in 18 years, but they find they're very alike: pigheaded, stubborn, passionate. It's a wonderful story of how you can't get away from how similar you and your children are.|John Schneider|Children, Father, Son 
Life cannot be without relationship, but we have made it so agonizing and hideous by basing it on personal and possessive love. Can one love and yet not possess?

My glasses are from Cutler & Gross. They're not prescription: I just love wearing them.

The minute that happens, it turns you off... and it does feel like it is taking something from you.|George Michael|Yourself, Strange, Camera 
The relationship between you and your boss will change over time. When you just started out, that boss was your mentor and took you under their wing. As a seasoned employee, though, you no longer need your boss to guide you along. You should be able to handle tasks on your own.|John Rampton|Change, Time, Boss 
To me, one of the big silver linings of the Simpson trial is the advances we've made in understanding domestic violence as a lethal problem.

When you're in a relationship, if you just break it down to regular terms, people are attracted to something, and that's what they want you to be, and that's what you should just be, and for me, it's very simple - if I meet a girl and I say, 'This is what I like about you. Just continue. Every day.'|Marilyn Manson|Day, Girl, Simple

When I was younger, the idea of the bad boy was appealing, but then I grew up and realized that stable people are more fulfilling. Bad boys need more time to themselves. I want to be in a relationship with someone who knows how to take care of himself and is therefore able to take care of me. That way, we can put each other first.|Jessica Parker Kennedy|Time, Me, People

I don't think any relationship responds well to pressure.|Adam Levine|Pressure, Think, Well 
What we need to understand is that when traditions become laws, rules, obligations and expectations others put on us that we don't want to fulfill, then they lose real meaning and steal the joy from our lives.

I work a lot of hours, and in this business you really try to keep as busy as you possibly can.

I feel there's a power in theatre, but it's an indirect power. It's like the relationship of the sleeper to the unconscious. You discover things you can't afford to countenance in waking life.

My father was on the Judiciary Committee all 18 years. He had a good personal relationship with Jim Eastland.

The U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world.|Max Baucus|World, Relationships 
Minimalism seems closest to the sophisticated storytelling of movies. Movies have really educated contemporary audiences to be the most intelligent, sophisticated audiences in history.

I just think the most important aspect in being able to have a productive relationship between the teachers' unions and the districts and the states that they're dealing with is that the person sitting across the table from them should not have received the largest campaign contributions from the teachers' union itself.|Mitt Romney|Think, The Most Important 
American official policy is that Egypt is an ally of the United States. Of course, we recognize that Egypt has gone through a dramatic change in government. And what their status will be going forward in terms of the relationship with our nation is something which which I'm sure will be developing over time.|Mitt Romney|Change, Time, Government 
Our relationship with Egypt is very, very important. And I would want them to remain an ally. I don't want to see that official status change.|Mitt Romney|Change, Want, See

I have a very healthy relationship to my work, and I find that if a scene is working, no matter how intense it is, you have the catharsis on screen, and you can let it go.

Poverty is a relationship that involves a lot of folks, rich and poor alike. I was looking for something that brought a lot of different people in a room. Eviction does that, embroils landlords and tenants, lawyers and social workers.|Matthew Desmond|Poverty, People, Rich 
I've always been spiritual but I've never had a proper context, and it took me awhile to find the proper context. It's hard to realize you can have any kind of relationship with God you want... and so I now have a punk rock relationship with God.|Billy Corgan|God, Spiritual, Me 
Christian children should be taught at an early age that everything they receive is because of God's grace and love.

Christian children should also be taught how to give.|Monica Johnson|Love, Children, Age

The ouster of Jill Abramson as executive editor of 'The New York Times' sent shock waves through the media landscape.

I suspect the real reason the N.F.L. and N.B.A. don't want high schoolers and college underclassmen to play with their ball is that they don't want to jeopardize their relationship with National Collegiate Athletic Association, which serves as a sort of free minor league and unpaid promotional department for the pros.|David Shields|College, Free, Want 
I think the core of fans' relationship is one that vacillates schizophrenically and mercurially from reverence to resentment.

When I got my first television set, I stopped caring so much about having close relationships.|Andy Warhol|Caring, Television

It is very difficult for persons who have had no special training to learn the names of the flowers from the botany.|John Burroughs|Family, Flower, Flowers 
If you're married, and you have a wife, and you really love your wife, is it good enough to only say to your wife 'I love her' the day you get married?

It's pretty easy for me to say that the most important thing in my life is my relationship with Jesus Christ, followed by my relationship with family. And football's later on down the line.|Tim Tebow|Life, Family, Football 
I mean, we're really making a quantum change in our relationship to the plant world with genetic modification.|Michael Pollan|Change, World, Plant

Regardless of the sexual orientation behind a relationship, it is still a relationship and still love.|Hozier|Love, Behind, Still 
When one is the type of writer who cares about the meaning of the historically specific setting, the history itself is not something that I would call backdrop. It's not window dressing for a timeless relationship about love and betrayal. For me, the setting and the specific history are active co-agents with me in trying to form the novel.|Rachel Kushner|Love, History, Me 
If you look at my characters as a group, they all have a different relationship with the way that places can signify emotion in them - and the way those bonds can be shattered.|Jhumpa Lahiri|Emotion, Group, You 
In terms of pace, I think I just have to revisit my relationship with expectations. That has a little bit to do with comparing ourselves to other people and seeing other people's journey and seeing how they had a certain success at a certain age.|Mahershala Ali|Success, Journey, Age 
I think the hardest thing to do in a relationship is something for yourself.|Kat Graham|Yourself, Think, Something

Absences are a good influence in love and keep it bright and delicate.|Robert Louis Stevenson|Love, Good, Influence 
I went through a phase when I was 13 where I would only fall in love with people over the age of 19 or 20. I never had a real relationship with any of these people, but it was definitely the guy I wanted to hang out with and wanted to go on trips with. I would be like, 'But, Daddy, he's a musician!'.|Olivia Wilde|Love, Age, Fall 
I had a great time making the last movie, 'Eclipse.' We shot my back-story stuff from the 1930's. But I was waiting for 'Breaking Dawn' because I love the relationship Rosalie has with Jacob and the rest of her family and Bella. She also provides comic relief.|Nikki Reed|Love, Family, Time 
I have a long-standing relationship with Autism Speaks. I've been supporting them for many, many years now.|Nikki Reed|Now, Autism, Years

If you ask me to describe my relationship, I mean - words are too clumsy to accurately describe how I feel in that regard, particularly in an interview. It's a strange thing.|Ryan Reynolds|Words, Me, Strange 
Remember: You are the common denominator in all your relationship problems. Wherever you go, your pesky repeated issues go - until you shed a blazing light of insight upon them.|Karen Salmansohn|Light, Problems, Remember 
Some people associate red with love, but to me, red is for an earlier stage of a relationship. Black is much deeper, to me. It's certainly the sexiest color.|Dierks Bentley|Love, Color, Red 
When you're doing collaborative music, the relationship that forms is a very bonding kind of experience.|Condoleezza Rice|Music, Experience, You 
I have fallen in love so many times. If one relationship ended, I would search for another girl. I was always madly in love with all the girls that I dated.|Nawazuddin Siddiqui|Love, Girl, Search

In any relationship, after the first year is over, you can't help but want your own space.|Helena Bonham Carter|Space, Help, Want 
Anything that has a relationship with pleasure, we reject it. Eating, they talk about cholesterol; making love, they talk about AIDS; you talk about smoking, they talk about cancer. It's a very sick society that rejects pleasure.|Marjane Satrapi|Love, Society, Cancer 
There's such an extreme feeling to be in love, especially in quite an emotionally destructive relationship, where you're both kind of really bad for each other, but you love each other so much. Those extreme emotions, I think, can only be described with extreme imagery.|Florence Welch|Love, Think, You 
Never assume that the guy understands that you and he have a relationship.|Dave Barry|You, Never, Assume 
Men are fair, and they have learned not to personalize anger - they can disagree with you and argue to the bone, but afterward they still consider you a nice person with whom the underlying human relationship need not be altered.|Warren Farrell|Anger, Men, Nice 
I have to say when a man lives for himself, it's hard to live with him. That's pretty much the story of all my divorces. I've been making records since I was 22 and done things my way, and it's hard for me to compromise. And of course, to have a successful relationship, one has to compromise. Sometimes I'm not good at it.|John Mellencamp|Good, Man, Me 
I love being onstage. I love the relationship with the audience. I love the letting go, the sense of discovery, the improvising.|Stephen Colbert|Love, Letting Go, Discovery

I'm in a monogamous relationship and have been for many, many years. I think it's a choice. I don't think you can generalize, though, and what works for me may not work for other people, but I don't think everybody cheats. We're all different.|Nikolaj Coster-Waldau|Work, Choice, Me 
I have a love-hate relationship with the Grammys because I don't see the music world as a competitive sport.|James Taylor|Music, World, See 
Filming 'Eclipse' - Eclipse was my favorite book so I was really excited to start filming the movie. I just love that it's the height of the love triangle.

I'm done with men... I'm going to be alone. I have no luck with relationships. I don't think I'm made for marriage.|Halle Berry|Marriage, Alone, Men

I think the most important thing for me in a relationship is honesty.|Zac Efron|Honesty, Me, Think 
My husband and I are either going to buy a dog or have a child. We can't decide whether to ruin our carpet or ruin our lives.|Rita Rudner|Dog, Child, Husband 
Trying to make something as tricky as 'Room' really believable is extremely hard, and it largely rests with that relationship between the actors and the director, and the director and the crew.|Lenny Abrahamson|Trying, Director, Between 
The intuitive connection children feel with animals can be a tremendous source of joy. The unconditional love received from pets, and the lack of artifice in the relationship, contrast sharply with the much trickier dealings with members of their own species.|Frans de Waal|Love, Children, Joy 
I don't need anyone to rectify my existence. The most profound relationship we will ever have is the one with ourselves.|Shirley MacLaine|Profound, Existence, Need 
Legal documents have mistrust written all over them. It's unfortunate, but the human DNA is so tuned to kind of taking you for granted that we tend to protect ourselves legally. That's why I don't read them as, if I read them, I will go soft. To me, the human relationship is far more important than the professional bond I share with anyone.|Karan Johar|Legal, Me, Professional 
Several companies have explicit policies against cronyism, with good reason. Hiring a family member simply for a relationship can be troubling and may not necessarily serve a company's interests. But by and large, financial firms in particular commonly hire people who have certain connections, whether through family or a business relationship.|Andrew Ross Sorkin|Family, Business, Good 
The man is meant to be the alpha in the relationship on the money and power front.|Jamie Dornan|Money, Power, Man 
Pop stardom is not very compelling. I'm much more interested in a relationship between performer and audience that is of equals. I came up through folk music, and there's no pomp and circumstance to the performance. There's no, like, 'I'll be the rock star, you be the adulating fan.'|Ani DiFranco|Music, Performance 
If a relationship has to be a secret, you shouldn't be in it.|Regina Brett|You, Secret 
I've never dealt with the Russian government, I've never had a relationship with the Russian government.|Paul Manafort|Government, Never, Dealt 
Most critical histories of U.S. involvement in Iran rightly began with the joint British-U.S. coup against democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, which installed Pahlavi on the Peacock Throne. But it was Kissinger who, in 1972, greatly deepened the relationship between Washington and Tehran.|Greg Grandin|Involvement, Between 
The problem is, when I talk about heartbreak or whatever, people want to melt it down to some break-up of a relationship, but it's not about that. If you're a sensitive person, just stepping outside can be heartbreaking.|Lykke Li|People, Problem, Want 
When you're in a relationship you want it to work. My parents did, I did. But we are not taught how to make it work.|Erykah Badu|Work, Parents, Want

With public figures involved in a relationship it seems that there is a machine behind their love so oftentimes.|Joaquin Phoenix|Love, Behind, Machine

The producer, in effect, has to work as a translator.

I can't even find someone for a platonic relationship, much less the kind where someone wants to see me naked.|Gilbert Gottfried|Me, Kind, See 
It's funny about men and women. Men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them. Women pay emotionally coming and going. Neither has it easy.|Hedy Lamarr|Funny, Women, Men 
If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I'm a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.|Katherine Jenkins|Love, Work, Age

It is certain that at certain times talent entirely overcomes thought or poetry.|John Singer Sargent|Thought, Talent, Times 
If you've ever been to a poetry slam, you know that the highest scoring emotion is self-righteous indignation: how dare you judge me.

I don't think I've ever read poetry, ever. I'm not really book-smart.|Eminem|Think, Ever, Really 
I think it's often assumed that the role of poetry is to comfort, but for me, poetry is the great unsettler. It questions the established order of the mind.

When you write, it's just a much more crystalline, compressed version of the voice you think with - though not the one you speak with. I think your writing voice is your laser-guided missile. It's the poetry part of you.|Douglas Coupland|Writing, Speak, Think

When I was 18, I took a trip to Thailand with a friend. We stayed for a month.

He may be wrongheaded, but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.|Chinua Achebe|Love, Beautiful, Passion 
Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It's delightful to distort size, to see something that's tiny as though it were vast.|Robert Morgan|Art, Think, See 
Poetry is not only a set of words which are chosen to relate to each other it is something which goes much further than that to provide a glimpse of our vision of the world. |Tahar Ben Jelloun|Vision, Words, World

Poetry fettered, fetters the human race. Nations are destroyed or flourish in proportion as their poetry, painting, and music are destroyed or flourish.|William Blake|Music, Painting, Human 
It is time to get drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of Time, get drunk; get drunk without stopping! On wine, on poetry, or on virtue, as you wish.|Charles Baudelaire|Time, Wine, Wish 
I've written poetry since I was in the first grade, and it wasn't until I was a little bit older that I realized poetry could be put to music and become a song.|Jordin Sparks|Music, Song, First 
I am two fools, I know, for loving, and for saying so in whining poetry.|John Donne|I Am, Loving, Know

If I read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can ever warm me, I know that is poetry.|Emily Dickinson|Book, Fire, Me 
Everything one invents is true, you may be perfectly sure of that. Poetry is as precise as geometry.|Gustave Flaubert|True, You, Geometry 
Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by singularity, it should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.|John Keats|Thoughts, Surprise, Fine 
The reason why we do maths is because it's like poetry. It's about patterns, and that really turned me on. It made me feel that maths was in tune with the other things I liked doing.|Marcus du Sautoy|Me, Doing, Why 
Let's detox our cluttered academic brain. That's what the poet does. People call it daydreaming, detoxing our minds and taking care of that clutter. It's being able to let in call letters from the poetry universe.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Brain, Universe, People 
A poet must be a psychologist, but a secret one: he should know and feel the roots of phenomena but present only the phenomena themselves in full bloom or as they fade away.|Ivan Turgenev|Roots, Know, Bloom 
The poetry you read has been written for you, each of you - black, white, Hispanic, man, woman, gay, straight.|Maya Angelou|Man, Woman, Black 
Poetry comes alive to me through recitation.|Natalie Merchant|Me, Alive, Through 
A theology should be like poetry, which takes us to the end of what words and thoughts can do.|Karen Armstrong|Thoughts, Words, End 
Poetry carries its history within it, and it is oral in origin. Its transmission was oral.|James Fenton|History, Within 
I am an artist, you understand? For me, a picture is like poetry. When you make art, this is not coming from an intellectual place. It's coming from the deep side of your unconscious, your soul.|Alejandro Jodorowsky|Art, Deep, I Am 
Wanted: a needle swift enough to sew this poem into a blanket.|Charles Simic|Enough, Blanket, Needle 
I do not see how a man can work on the frontiers of physics and write poetry at the same time. They are in opposition.|Paul Dirac|Work, Time, Man 
The thing about great poetry is we have no defenses against it.|David Whyte|Great, Against, About 
I think the poetry that came out of Belfast, and especially the Queen's University set, in the 1970s and '80s - you know, Paul Muldoon and Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon and Ciaran Carson - that was probably the finest body of work since the Gaelic renaissance, up there with the work of Yeats and Synge and Lady Gregory.|Adrian McKinty|Work, Queen, Know 
I'm not really a musician. I'm a performer, and I love rock n' roll. I've embraced rock n' roll because it encompasses all the things I'm interested in: poetry, revolution, sexuality, political activism - all of these things can be found in rock n' roll.|Patti Smith|Love, Revolution, Political 
I wish our clever young poets would remember my homely definitions of prose and poetry; that is, prose = words in their best order; - poetry = the best words in the best order.|Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Best, Words, Remember 
The poetry of a people comes from the deep recesses of the unconscious, the irrational and the collective body of our ancestral memories.|Margaret Walker|Memories, Deep, People 
Bleak House is just the most astounding piece of work. There's huge, visionary poetry in it.|Simon Callow|Work, House, Visionary 
Have you ever heard a good joke? If you've ever heard someone just right, with the right pacing, then you're already on the way to poetry. It's about using words in very precise ways and using gesture.|Rita Dove|Good, Words, You 
I love Sufism as I love beautiful poetry, but it is not the answer. Sufism is like a mirage in the desert. It says to you, come and sit, relax and enjoy yourself for a while.|Naguib Mahfouz|Love, Beautiful, Yourself 
Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds.|Percy Bysshe Shelley|Best, Moments, Minds 
Written poetry is worth reading once, and then should be destroyed. Let the dead poets make way for others.|Antonin Artaud|Reading, Way, Dead 
Poetry isn't a profession, it's a way of life. It's an empty basket; you put your life into it and make something out of that.|Mary Oliver|Life, Way, You 
It's not easy to define poetry.|Bob Dylan|Easy, Define 
I don't like the word 'poetry,' and I don't like poetry readings, and I usually don't like poets. I would much prefer describing myself and what I do as: I'm kind of a curator, and I'm kind of a night-owl reporter.|Tom Waits|Myself, Kind, Like 
I began writing early - very, very early... I was already writing short stories for the radio and selling poems to poetry and art festivals; I was involved in school plays; I wrote essays, so there was no definite moment when I said, 'Now I'm a writer.' I've always been a writer.|Wole Soyinka|Art, School, Short 
I've always written. There's a journal which I kept from about 9 years old. The man who gave it to me lived across the street from the store and kept it when my grandmother's papers were destroyed. I'd written some essays. I loved poetry, still do. But I really, really loved it then.|Maya Angelou|Man, Me, Loved 
For an American, there's no automatic place where people love the art of poetry. There's not a social class that considers poetry its property the way in some countries there's a snob value to the art.|Robert Pinsky|Love, Art, American 
If I have to make a self-portrait, I would put poetry and rebellion on the list. To be able to walk on a wire, to be able to juggle six hoops, you need focus, another word for tenacity, which is passion.|Philippe Petit|Focus, Passion, Walk 
The Victorian language of flowers began with the publication of 'Le Language des Fleurs,' written by Charlotte de Latour and printed in Paris in 1819. To create the book - which was a list of flowers and their meanings - de Latour gathered references to flower symbolism throughout poetry, ancient mythology, and even medicine.|Vanessa Diffenbaugh|Flower, Flowers, Book 
I have written some poetry and two prose books about baseball, but if I had been a rich man, I probably would not have written many of the magazine essays that I have had to do. But, needing to write magazine essays to support myself, I looked to things that I cared about and wanted to write about, and certainly baseball was one of them.|Donald Hall|Myself, Baseball, Support 
Poetry is one of the ancient arts, and it began as did all the fine arts, within the original wilderness of the earth.|Mary Oliver|Earth, Wilderness, Within 
I came into music because I thought the presentation of poetry wasn't vibrant enough. So I merged improvised poetry with basic rock chords. That was my original mission.|Patti Smith|Music, Thought, Mission 
Like most lit nerds, I'm a voracious reader. I never got enough poetry under my belt growing up but I do read it - some of my favorites, Gina Franco and Angela Shaw and Cornelius Eady and Kevin Young, remind me daily that unless the words sing and dance, what's the use of putting them down on paper.|Junot Diaz|Daily, Dance, Words 
Each word bears its weight, so you have to read my poems quite slowly.|Anne Stevenson|You, Word, Slowly 
Superstition is the poetry of life.|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Life, Superstition 
I started off in England and very few people knew I was Australian. I mean, the clues were in the poems, but they didn't read them very carefully, and so for years and years I was considered completely part of the English poetry scene.|Peter Porter|People, Years, Mean 
The Bible is not just one book, but an entire library, with stories, songs, poetry, letters and history, as well as literature that might more obviously qualify as 'religious.'|John Drane|History, Book, Library 
Human beings love poetry. They don't even know it sometimes... whether they're the songs of Bono, or the songs of Justin Bieber... they're listening to poetry.|Maya Angelou|Love, Listening, Know 
If the poetry world celebrate its female stars at the true level of their productivity and influence, poetry would wind up being a largely female world, and the men would leave.|Eileen Myles|Stars, Men, World 
The moment of change is the only poem.|Adrienne Rich|Change, Moment, Poem

A poet can survive everything but a misprint.|Oscar Wilde|Survive, Everything, Poet 
All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling.|Oscar Wilde|Feeling, Genuine, Bad

The crown of literature is poetry.|W. Somerset Maugham|Literature, Crown 
A poet looks at the world the way a man looks at a woman.|Wallace Stevens|Man, Woman, World

There may be more poetry than justice in poetic justice.|George Will|Justice, May, Than

Poetry is all nouns and verbs.|Marianne Moore|Verbs 
The blood jet is poetry and there is no stopping it.|Sylvia Plath|Blood, Jet, Stopping 
I think that the job of poetry, its political job, is to refresh the idea of justice, which is going dead in us all the time.|Robert Hass|Time, Justice, Job 
Poetry is a sort of homecoming.|Paul Celan|Homecoming, Sort 
I didn't want to deal in poetry. I got rid of that after a few months.|Tom Wesselmann|Want, Rid, Months 
Of course a poem is a two-way street. No poem is any good if it doesn't suggest to the reader things from his own mind and recollection that he will read into it, and will add to what the poet has suggested. But I do think poetry readings are very important.|James Laughlin|Good, Mind, Think 
Pound's translation of Chinese poetry was maybe the most important thing I read. Eliot a little bit later.|Robert Morgan|The Most Important, Little 
A group of us started a community center in Santa Monica. We've tried different programs, and three have worked really well. A poetry group. Once a week we visit Venice High and talk to girls at risk.|Lisa Bonet|Community, Risk, Week 
Slowly poetry becomes visual because it paints images, but it is also musical: it unites two arts into one.|Eugenio Montale|Arts, Visual, Two 
What we know is that Shakespeare wrote perhaps the most remarkable body of passionate love poetry in the English language to a young man.|Stephen Greenblatt|Love, Man, Language 
So, poetry becomes a means for useful dialogue between people who are not only unknown, but mute to each other. It produces a dialogue among people that guards all of us against manipulation by our so-called leaders.|June Jordan|People, Unknown, Dialogue 
Writing poetry makes you intensely conscious of how words sound, both aloud and inside the head of the reader. You learn the weight of words and how they sound to the ear.|Helen Dunmore|Writing, Words, You 
I want a fever, in poetry: a fever, and tranquillity.|James Dickey|Want, Fever, Tranquillity 
Why should poetry have to make sense?|Charlie Chaplin|Why, Sense, Should 
The poetry of this one is called philosophical, of that one philological, of a third rhetorical, and so on. Which is then the poetic poetry?|Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Third, Rhetorical, Which 
Yet, it is true, poetry is delicious; the best prose is that which is most full of poetry.|Virginia Woolf|Best, True, Which 
The musician is perhaps the most modest of animals, but he is also the proudest. It is he who invented the sublime art of ruining poetry.|Erik Satie|Art, Animals, Musician 
I see people who talk about America, and then undermine it by not paying attention to its soul, to its poetry. I see polarization, reductionism and superficiality.|Azar Nafisi|America, Soul, People 
I always wrote poetry and stuff like that, so putting songs together wasn't that spectacular.|Amy Winehouse|Together, Always, Like 
When I hit a block, regardless of what I am writing, what the subject matter is, or what's going on in the plot, I go back and I read Pablo Neruda's poetry. I don't actually speak Spanish, so I read it translation. But I always go back to Neruda. I don't know why, but it calms me, calms my brain.|Tea Obreht|I Am, Writing, Speak 
The middle class is doing fine in fiction. But it's not what gets me going. I love the working class, and everyone from it I've met, and think they're incredibly witty, inventive - there's a lot of poetry there.|Martin Amis|Love, Me, Think 
I read poetry to save time.|Marilyn Monroe|Time, Save, Read 
The poetry and transgression that was so much of surrealism's anarchic force has been recruited into mainstream culture. It has been made commonplace by television and magazine merchandising, by computer games and Internet visuals, by film and MTV, by the fashion shoot.|Graham Joyce|Culture, Internet 
Modernism in other arts brought extreme difficulty. In poetry, the characteristic difficulty imported under the name of modernism was obscurity. But obscurity could just as easily be a quality of metrical as of free verse.|James Fenton|Quality, Free, Name 
Poetry, for me, is the answer to, 'How does one stay sane when private lives are being ransacked by public events?' It's something that hangs over your head all the time.|Lisel Mueller|Time, Me, Head 
Poetry is my cheap means of transportation. By the end of the poem the reader should be in a different place from where he started. I would like him to be slightly disoriented at the end, like I drove him outside of town at night and dropped him off in a cornfield.|Billy Collins|End, Night, Transportation 
I think of something quite different from a snapshot. I know of a lot of poems, some very fine ones, that are like snapshots, but I'm more interested in poetry that is like an endless film, long stories, things that weave together many different strands, like a big piece of cloth, not like a photograph.|Robert Bringhurst|Together, Long, Know 
As far as I am concerned, poetry is a statement concerning the human condition, composed in verse.|N. Scott Momaday|I Am, Human, Human Condition 
My father loved poetry and music. But deep in himself he thought teaching the finest thing a person could do.|George Steiner|Music, Father, Deep 
One night, I lay awake for hours, just terrified. When the dawn finally came up - the comfortable blue sky, the familiar world returning - I could think of no other way to express my relief than through poetry. I made a decision there and then that it was what I wanted to do. Every time I pulled a wishbone, it was what I asked for.|Alice Oswald|Time, Sky, World 
Poetry, fiction as novels or short stories - these are autonomous as created by their authors. They should stand on their own, like pieces of furniture that should be judged as to their usefulness, elegance.|F. Sionil Jose|Short, Stand, Furniture 
I am for poetry that is admired by peasant and aristocrat alike.|F. Sionil Jose|I Am, Peasant, Alike 
For me, I used to be shy towards journalism because it wasn't poetry. And then I realized that the events that I covered in essays that became journalism were actually great because they inspired me, and they became my muse.|Alice Walker|Great, Me, Journalism 
In Northern Ireland, helicopters are not usually used to promote poetry.|Seamus Heaney|Ireland, Northern Ireland 
I admire 'Adventure Time' for being a piece of art in the way that I think art should be. If you want to see it is poetry, you can, and if you don't, you can watch a fun cartoon.|Rebecca Sugar|Time, Art, Adventure 
When I was young, I read everything I could lay my hands on, but the Scots in my storybooks spent their time fighting glorious battles, rowing across lochs, or escaping over moors of purple heather. Even those Scots were hard to find. For at school, we recited poetry according to the set texts the teachers taught us.|Theresa Breslin|Time, School, Hands 
Surrealism is not a poetry but a poetics, and even more, and more decisively, a world vision.|Octavio Paz|Vision, World, Surrealism 
Many great works of art, poetry, and music are inspired by astral memories. The desire to do noble, beautiful things here on Earth is also often a carryover of astral experiences between a person's earth lives.|Paramahansa Yogananda|Music, Art, Beautiful 
I owe my discovery of the Hot Club of Cowtown to Kinky Friedman, leader of the Texas Jewboys. When I saw that Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys were headlining the 2003 Santa Clarita Cowboy Poetry and Music Festival, I thought it my duty to check out the band that had inspired the Texas Jewboys.|Clive Sinclair|Music, Leader, Thought 
I like cups of tea and reading books and poetry and old people things.|Bindi Irwin|Reading, Tea, People 
Poetry is a call to action, and it also is action.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Action, Call, Also 
The muse, the beloved, and duende are three ways of thinking of what is the source of poetry, and all three seem to me different names or different ways to think about something that is not entirely reasonable, not entirely subject to the will, not entirely rational.|Edward Hirsch|Thinking, Me, Think 
In poetry, I have, since very young, loved poetry in translation. The Chinese, the French, the Russians, Italians, Indians and early Celts: the formality of the translator's voice, their measured breath and anxiety moves me as it lingers over the original.|Fanny Howe|Me, Voice, Anxiety 
There is a gap in my work from '84 to 2002, 18 years where I stopped writing. I was working at fiction and other things and starting a school and getting married and starting a family, but I wasn't writing poetry for the better part of 15 years.|Philip Schultz|Work, Family, School 
The major poets of New Jersey have all suffered, whether it's Whitman, who lost his job for 'Leaves of Grass,' or William Carlos Williams, who was called a communist, or Ginsberg, whose 'Howl' was prosecuted, or myself. If you practise poetry the way I think it needs to be done, you're going to put yourself in jeopardy.|Amiri Baraka|Myself, Job, Yourself 
I do believe that we've a responsibility to try to acknowledge the range, both geographic and graphic, of what's happening in poetry in English. I'm interested in poems that are first-rate. After that, I'm not too concerned if they come from Queens or Queensland.|Paul Muldoon|Responsibility, Believe, Try 
When I get depressed, I try to get something for the terrible sadness that comes over me and create something in terms of poetry.|Spike Milligan|Sadness, Me, Try 
The applause of his native land is the richest reward to which the patriot ever aspires. It is this for which 'he bears to live or dares to die.' It is the high incentive to those achievements which illustrate the page of history and give to poetry its brightest charm.|John Tyler|History, Live, Page 
The topics just kind of come to me. If they are relevant, it's because they're happening in the world around me, and it's affecting me. Poetry is my way of dealing with it.|Rupi Kaur|World, Me, Dealing 
There is no Frigate like a book to take us lands away nor any coursers like a page of prancing Poetry.|Emily Dickinson|Book, Page, Like 
Money is a kind of poetry.|Wallace Stevens|Money, Kind 
Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance... poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music.|Ezra Pound|Music, Dance, Far 
Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are rather of the nature of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.|Aristotle|Nature, History, Something 
The Bible should be taught, but emphatically not as reality. It is fiction, myth, poetry, anything but reality. As such it needs to be taught because it underlies so much of our literature and our culture.|Richard Dawkins|Culture, Reality, Bible 
Every now and then I read a poem that does touch something in me, but I never turn to poetry for solace or pleasure in the way that I throw myself into prose.|J. K. Rowling|Myself, Me, Pleasure 
Verse in itself does not constitute poetry. Verse is only an elegant vestment for a beautiful form. Poetry can express itself in prose, but it does so more perfectly under the grace and majesty of verse. It is poetry of soul that inspires noble sentiments and noble actions as well as noble writings.|Victor Hugo|Beautiful, Soul, Grace 
I want to promote poetry to the point where you got all the baldhead kids running around doing poetry, getting the music out of the way and having only words, the spoken word, and then see what happens.|Russell Simmons|Music, Words, Want 
Anybody serious about poetry knows how hard it is to achieve anything worthwhile in it.|Seamus Heaney|Achieve, Serious, Anything 
Often people, when they're confronted with a poem, it's like someone who keep saying 'what is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this?' And that dulls us to the other pleasures poetry offers.|Billy Collins|People, Meaning, Saying 
Radio is such a perfect medium for the transmission of poetry, primarily because there just is the voice, there's no visual distraction.|Billy Collins|Voice, Perfect, Visual 
I know my voice has a limited range of motion; I don't write dramatic monologues and pretend to be other people. But so far, my voice is broad enough to accommodate most of what I want to put into my poetry. I like my persona; I often wish I were him and not me.|Billy Collins|Me, People, Want 
Making poetry with a camera - that's the essence of what I do.|Denis Villeneuve|Camera, Essence, Making 
Poetry must have something in it that is barbaric, vast and wild.|Denis Diderot|Wild, Something, Must 
Stylized acting and direction is to realistic acting and direction as poetry is to prose.|Elia Kazan|Direction, Acting, Realistic 
Instead of trying to come up and pontificate on what literature is, you need to talk with children, to teachers, and make sure they get poetry in the curriculum early.|Rita Dove|Children, Literature, You 
The experience of poetry could bring my mother back to me. Poetry offers a different kind of solace - here on earth.|Natasha Trethewey|Experience, Mother, Me 
I like to borrow forms and quotes and use a lot of allusions, in both poetry and music.|Jamila Woods|Music, Like, Borrow 
Sunday is a likely day to write a poem. Because poetry is a piece of language flying around: you'll find notebooks, something on your phone. It's about finding them and getting them off that crumpled piece of paper and onto my computer.|Eileen Myles|Day, Language, Flying 
Poetry can tell us about what's going on in our lives - not only our personal but our social and political lives.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Political, Personal, Social 
For this reason poets and artists developed the doctrine of Art for Art's Sake. The community did not appear to need them, so, tit for tat, they did not need the community. This being granted, it was no longer necessary or even desirable to make one's poetry either intelligible or sympathetic to the community.|Louis MacNeice|Art, Community, Reason 
Good poets have written in order to describe something or to preach something - with their eye on the object or the end. The essence of the poetry does not lie in the thing described or in the message imparted but in the resulting concrete unity, the poem.|Louis MacNeice|Good, Unity, Eye 
I liked to write from the time I was about 12 or 13. I loved to read. And since I only spoke to my brother, I would write down my thoughts. And I think I wrote some of the worst poetry west of the Rockies. But by the time I was in my 20s, I found myself writing little essays and more poetry - writing at writing.|Maya Angelou|Time, Myself, Brother 
I wrote some of the worst poetry west from the Mississippi River, but I wrote. And I finally sometimes got it right.|Maya Angelou|River, Sometimes, Right 
I find in my poetry and prose the rhythms and imagery of the best - I mean, when I'm at my best - of the good Southern black preachers. The lyricism of the spirituals and the directness of gospel songs and the mystery of blues are in my music or in my poetry and prose, or I missed everything.|Maya Angelou|Music, Good, Best 
I'm happy to be a writer - of prose, poetry, every kind of writing. Every person in the world who isn't a recluse, hermit or mute uses words. I know of no other art form that we always use.|Maya Angelou|Art, Happy, Words 
I think that there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself than this incessant business.|Henry David Thoreau|Life, Business, Philosophy 
There's a love of rhetorical skill in the Muslim world. Osama bin Laden doesn't just go on tape cassettes and say, 'America sucks.' He recites poetry; he finds things that 'America sucks' rhymes with.|P. J. O'Rourke|Love, America, World 
It could be that all awful dictators are frustrated artists - Mao with his poetry and Mussolini with his monuments. Stalin was once a journalistic hack, and I can personally testify to how frustrated they are. Pol Pot left a very edgy photo collection behind. And Osama seems quite interested in video.|P. J. O'Rourke|I Can, Monuments, Edgy 
I felt like my favorite writers have almost musical hooks in their work, whether it's poetry or a hook at the end of a chapter that makes you want to read the next one. And I think that my favorite writers definitely have something musical about what they do, in saying something so relatable and universal and so simple.|Taylor Swift|Work, Simple, End 
Poetry and lyrics are very similar. Making words bounce off a page.|Taylor Swift|Words, Page, Bounce 
We explore our environment, more than we are compelled to utter poetry, when we're toddlers. We start doing that later. Before that happens, every child is a scientist.|Neil deGrasse Tyson|Child, Start, Environment 
When Auden said his poetry didn't save one Jew from the gas chamber, he'd said it all.|Tom Stoppard|Said, Save, Gas 
Science arose from poetry... when times change the two can meet again on a higher level as friends.|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Change, Friends, Science 
You don't have to be a renowned artist like Q-Tip to try your hand at poetry. You don't need any special equipment - that's the beauty of it.|Michelle Obama|Beauty, Artist, You 
Poetry has done enough when it charms, but prose must also convince.|H. L. Mencken|Done, Enough, Convince 
The Bible is very resonant. It has everything: creation, betrayal, lust, poetry, prophecy, sacrifice. All great things are in the Bible, and all great writers have drawn from it and more than people realise, whether Shakespeare, Herman Melville or Bob Dylan.|Patti Smith|Great, Sacrifice, Bible 
What I wanted to do in rock 'n roll was merge poetry with sonic scapes, and the two people who had contributed so much to that were Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison.|Patti Smith|People, Rock, Two People 
When I was younger, I felt it was my duty to wake people up. I thought poetry was asleep. I thought rock 'n' roll was asleep.|Patti Smith|Thought, People, Rock 
I didn't love Jim Morrison 'cause he was self-destructive. I loved him because of his work. Because of the way he merged poetry and rock-and-roll. Because he did something new.|Patti Smith|Love, Work, Loved 
Rhyme, that enslaved queen, that supreme charm of our poetry, that creator of our meter.|Victor Hugo|Queen, Charm, Rhyme 
In the French language, there is a great gulf between prose and poetry; in English, there is hardly any difference. It is a splendid privilege of the great literary languages Greek, Latin, and French that they possess a prose. English has not this privilege. There is no prose in English.|Victor Hugo|Great, Language, Difference 
Writing criticism is to writing fiction and poetry as hugging the shore is to sailing in the open sea.|John Updike|Sea, Writing, Criticism 
I must say, when I reread myself, it's the poetry I tend to look at. It's the most exciting to write, and it's over the quickest.|John Updike|Myself, Look, Say 
Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind. Music depends on details of the auditory system, painting and sculpture on the visual system. Poetry and literature depend on language.|Steven Pinker|Music, Art, Mind 
The fact that Newark is having poetry festivals and peace conferences - all of these things are building an undeniable thesis that our city is making incredible strides forward.|Cory Booker|Peace, City, Building 
On the subject of literary genres, I've always felt that my response to poetry is inadequate. I'd love to be the kind of person that drifts off into the garden with a slim volume of Elizabethan verse or a sheaf of haikus, but my passion is story.|J. K. Rowling|Love, Passion, Garden 
As an actor, there is room for a certain amount of creativity, but you're always ultimately going to be saying somebody else's words. I don't think I'd have the stamina, skill or ability to write a novel, but I'd love to write short stories and poetry, because those are my two passions.|Daniel Radcliffe|Love, Creativity, Words 
I don't think I'd have the stamina, skill or ability to write a novel, but I'd love to write short stories and poetry, because those are my two passions.|Daniel Radcliffe|Love, Short, Think 
On a practical level, poetry isn't something anybody has really made a great living at. I might sell some books and, once in a while, someone might pay to hear me read.|Viggo Mortensen|Great, Me, Living 
Photography, painting or poetry - those are just extensions of me, how I perceive things; they are my way of communicating.|Viggo Mortensen|Me, Photography, Painting 
I have a publishing company of books by me and books of others. It drew people to poetry readings and photo exhibitions and painting exhibitions that I've been doing for years before that.|Viggo Mortensen|Me, Painting, Company 
I've been reading poetry publicly for 20 years, and this is what you do - you express, you sometimes dig a bit to get a conversation started. That's the point of poetry. You're supposed to go, 'Hmmmm,' and 'Woooh!'|Jill Scott|Reading, Conversation, You 
I was reading poetry to my girlfriends, and they were like, 'You're really good. You should go to some poetry readings or something.' And I eventually went and got a, you know, somewhat of a name for myself and a little bit of a following.|Jill Scott|Good, Myself, Reading 
The claims I'm making for art are simply the claims that we naturally make around music or around poetry. We're much more relaxed around those art forms. We're willing to ask, 'How could this find a place in my heart?'|Alain de Botton|Music, Art, Heart 
Dylan captured what was on a million minds and turned it into poetry. With 'Blowin' in the Wind' or 'The Times They Are A-Changin',' he set a whole new standard.|Jimmy Iovine|Wind, New, Minds 
Existential philosophy, poetry and art - just like sadness - were all unavoidable to a tender young man in the meat works.|Michael Leunig|Art, Man, Sadness 
When I am writing fiction, I believe I am much better organized, more methodical - one has to be when writing a novel. Writing poetry is a state of free float.|Margaret Atwood|I Am, Writing, Believe 
I don't think of poetry as a 'rational' activity but as an aural one. My poems usually begin with words or phrases which appeal more because of their sound than their meaning, and the movement and phrasing of a poem are very important to me.|Margaret Atwood|Words, Me, Meaning 
Americans have been tremendously fortunate in poetry, regarding both the quantity and quality of poetry produced. Unfortunately, it remains in schools and universities; it is not widely distributed.|Joseph Brodsky|Quality, Quantity, Fortunate 
Poetry is rather an approach to things, to life, than it is typographical production.|Joseph Brodsky|Life, Production, Approach 
Poetry seems to be the only weapon able to beat language, using language's own means.|Joseph Brodsky|Language, Seems, Beat 
To translate poetry, one has to possess some art, at the very least the art of stylistic re-embodiment.|Joseph Brodsky|Art, Some, Stylistic 
The more one reads poetry, the less tolerant one becomes of any sort of verbosity, be that in political or philosophical discourse, be that in history, social studies or the art of fiction.|Joseph Brodsky|Art, History, Political 
My idea is simply - is very simple - is that the books of poetry should be published in far greater volume and be distributed in far greater volume, in far more substantial manner. You can sell in supermarkets very cheaply. In paperbacks. You can sell in drugstores.|Joseph Brodsky|Simple, You, Idea 
This assumption that the blue collar crowd is not supposed to read it, or a farmer in his overalls is not to read poetry, seems to be dangerous if not tragic.|Joseph Brodsky|Blue, Farmer, Dangerous 
I am a patriot, but I must say that English poetry is the richest in the world.|Joseph Brodsky|I Am, World, Patriot 
Poetry is not an art or a branch of art: it's something more.|Joseph Brodsky|Art, Something, Branch 
Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as a 'read,' commits an anthropological crime, in the first place against himself.|Joseph Brodsky|Crime, Place, Entertainment 
American poetry to me is a sort of relentless, nonstop sermon on human autonomy.|Joseph Brodsky|American, Me, Human 
Tyranny will make an entire population into readers of poetry.|Joseph Brodsky|Tyranny, Will, Population 
American poetry is this country's greatest patrimony. It takes a stranger to see some things clearly. This is one of them, and I am that stranger.|Joseph Brodsky|I Am, American, Greatest 
Poetry isn't just different from prose, it's more important for the human species.|Joseph Brodsky|Important, Human, Different 
The charge frequently leveled against poetry - that it is difficult, obscure, hermetic and whatnot - indicates not the state of poetry but, frankly, the rung of the evolutionary ladder on which society is stuck.|Joseph Brodsky|Society, Ladder, Difficult 
People who buy 'The National Enquirer' would buy poetry. They should be given a choice. I'm absolutely serious.|Joseph Brodsky|Choice, People, Serious 
People compose poetry, novels, sitcoms - for love.|Helen Fisher|Love, People, Compose 
Being able to say something lyrically, to say something that will do more than just be words, is really hard. It's easy to do when you're writing a chapter of a book or writing poetry, but it's really hard to do when you're confined to a melody line.|Nikki Sixx|Writing, Book, Words 
That metre itself forms an essential part of all true poetry is a principle which not even the assertions of an Aristotle or the pronouncements of a Plato can disestablish.|H. P. Lovecraft|True, Part, Which 
When you are writing literary writing, you are communicating something subtextual with emotions and poetry. The prose has to have a voice; it's not just typing. It takes a while to get that voice.|Joyce Carol Oates|Writing, Voice, You 
I'm moved by people who see the world differently than others. People who see the world with a longing for its poetry often can be broken people.|Laura Dern|World, People, Broken 
For awhile after you quit Keats all other poetry seems to be only whistling or humming.|F. Scott Fitzgerald|You, Quit, Seems 
What is beautiful enchants me. I mean not just physical beauty but a wider concept of beauty. There is beauty in poetry and in great musical or singing performances. There is beauty everywhere if you can just see it.|Andrea Bocelli|Beauty, Beautiful, Great 
Personally I always feel like I could use a little more of poetry apothegmatic power in my own work but we're always lacking something.|Junot Diaz|Work, Power, Little 
I didn't start writing songs, honestly, until I started making my album. I was always doing poetry, but I never thought I could write songs. I discouraged myself and thought it was so hard. But starting this process and learning just what it is to be a songwriter and performer taught me that you don't have to feel discouraged about anything.|Alessia Cara|Learning, Myself, Writing 
In much of computer science, I can easily 'auto-grade' your work and give you an instant meaningful feedback. I can't do this when it comes to the subtlety of human thought, language, poetry, philosophy.|Sebastian Thrun|Work, Science, Philosophy 
I want to branch out. I want to write. I write poetry. I want to see my children grow up well.|Annie Lennox|Children, Grow, Want 
Poetry is all that is worth remembering in life.|William Hazlitt|Life, Worth, Remembering 
Shakespeare is rhythmic; he is musical in the sense that he likes poetry, and he's musical because he constantly refers to settings where there's singing and dancing.|Kenneth Branagh|Singing, Sense, Where 
Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.|Aung San Suu Kyi|Age, Become, Something 
I love reading poetry, and yet, at this point, the thought of writing a poem, to me, is tantamount to figuring out a trigonometry question.|Jhumpa Lahiri|Love, Writing, Reading 
It's just poetry, beauty and love. How hard can that be to act?|Robin Wright|Love, Beauty, Just 
I certainly derived my skills as a prose writer from my scrutiny of poetry and of the individual word. But schools don't do things like that anymore - tracking words down to their roots.|Camille Paglia|Roots, Words, Down 
When the poet is in love, he is incapable of writing poetry on love. He has to write when he remembers that he was in love.|Umberto Eco|Love, Writing, Write 
I have felt great advances in my poetry, the main one being a growing victory over word nuances and a superfluity of adjectives.|Sylvia Plath|Great, Victory, Growing 
Well, I still write poetry, but I wouldn't call myself a poet.|David Duchovny|Myself, Well, Still 
Well you can't teach the poetry, but you can teach the craft.|David Hockney|Teach, You, Craft

No poems can please for long or live that are written by water drinkers.|Horace|Water, Live, Long 
The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world... to see clearly is poetry, prophecy and religion all in one.|John Ruskin|Religion, Soul, World 
There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage. I don't like doing what people expect me to do.|Dave Grohl|Me, People, Doing 
I've read a lot of war writing, even World War I writing, the British war poetry of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves's memoir 'Goodbye to All That,' and a civilian memoir, 'Testament of Youth,' by Vera Brittain.|George Packer|War, Goodbye, Writing 
You pick up loads of baggage with your first record with reaction to it from fans and critics. So I went to Ireland by myself for a couple of weeks with my guitar. I read lots of poetry, I read Patti Smith's autobiography and started words and phrases and then songs started to take shape.|Ellie Goulding|Myself, Words, Guitar 
When I was in college, I really liked poetry. I don't read much anymore.|Steve Martin|College, Anymore, Liked 
I want to write a play. I'd like to do an original musical. I should probably put together a poetry collection.|Neil Gaiman|Together, Want, Play 
We are supposed to write poetry to keep the gods alive.|Jim Harrison|Alive, Gods, Write 
I think poetry is able to say things in such a small, perfect way that are so hard to say. I think it's a perfect medium for expressing difficult ideas and concepts and feelings. It's one of my great loves.|Jerry Hall|Great, Ideas, Small 
I find a lot of poetry to be narcissistic.|Joni Mitchell|Find, Narcissistic, Lot 
Poetry consists in a rhyming dictionary and things seen.|Gertrude Stein|Dictionary, Things, Seen 
Poetry has, in a way, been my bridge to my acting career.|Omari Hardwick|Bridge, Acting, Career 
I found poetry at 12 and 13 and, lo and behold, learned that my attorney father had a background in poetry - as he wore dashikis and Afros in the '70s and named his kids Arabic names. He was a poet and a lot like The Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron and all of these folks. He definitely was an artist.|Omari Hardwick|Father, Artist, Kids 
I was trying to pay the bills with poems, and it was easy to memorize my poems, because I'd be riding my bike in California trying to memorize them before going on stage at a poetry lounge.|Omari Hardwick|Bike, Trying, Easy 
That's the thing with me being a former athlete: in the way I attack characters and attack poetry is from the base of being an athlete.|Omari Hardwick|Me, Athlete, Way 
Poetry is almost like my foundation for everything. I almost feel I am a better actor and writer because of it.|Omari Hardwick|I Am, Foundation, Better 
The fact of the matter is that the most unexpected and miraculous thing in my life was the arrival in it of poetry itself - as a vocation and an elevation almost.|Seamus Heaney|Life, My Life, Unexpected 
Nowadays, what an award gives is a sense of solidarity with the poetry guild, as it were: sustenance coming from the assent of your peers on the judging panel.|Seamus Heaney|Award, Judging, Solidarity 
I credit poetry for making this space-walk possible.|Seamus Heaney|Credit, Possible, Making 
Manifesting that order of poetry where we can at last grow up to that which we stored up as we grew.|Seamus Heaney|Grow, Grow Up, Where 
Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry.|Seamus Heaney|History, Chapter, Now 
A public expectation, it has to be said, not of poetry as such but of political positions variously approvable by mutually disapproving groups.|Seamus Heaney|Political, Expectation, Said 
The completely solitary self: that's where poetry comes from, and it gets isolated by crisis, and those crises are often very intimate also.|Seamus Heaney|Self, Crisis, Where 
Poetry is always slightly mysterious, and you wonder what is your relationship to it.|Seamus Heaney|Relationship, You 
The experimental poetry thing is not my thing. It's a programme of the avant-garde: basically a refusal of the kind of poetry I write.|Seamus Heaney|Kind, Write, Experimental 
The experiment of poetry, as far as I am concerned, happens when the poem carries you beyond where you could have reasonably expected to go.|Seamus Heaney|I Am, You, Experiment 
In the United States, in poetry workshops, it's now quite a thing to make graduate students learn poems by heart.|Seamus Heaney|Heart, Learn, Students 
In poetry, everything can be faked but the intensity of utterance.|Seamus Heaney|Everything, Intensity 
Tom Sleigh's poetry is hard-earned and well founded. I great admire the way it refuses to cut emotional corners and yet achieves a sense of lyric absolution.|Seamus Heaney|Great, Admire, Emotional 
Poetry is a domestic art, most itself when most at home.|Seamus Heaney|Art, Home, Most 
Poetry is more a threshold than a path.|Seamus Heaney|Path, Than, Threshold 
A play is basically a long, formalistic polemic. You can write it without the poetry, and if you do, you may have a pretty good play. We know this because we see plays in translation. Not many people speak Norwegian or Danish or whatever guys like Ibsen spoke, or Russian - yet we understand Chekhov and the others.|David Mamet|Good, Speak, People 
It's always a combination of physics and poetry that I find inspiring. It's hard to wrap your head around things like the Hubble scope.|Tom Hanks|Head, Physics, Find 
There isn't, even now, a great tradition of novel-writing in Afghanistan. Most of the literature is in the form of poetry.|Khaled Hosseini|Great, Tradition, Literature 
I learn poetry, learn text, and that really keeps you alive.|Anthony Hopkins|Learn, You, Alive 
Metaphorical tone deafness is when people are unable to discern what is of value in something. I think I'm tone deaf to poetry, for instance. Despite having studied it into a second year of university, most of it just leaves me cold.|Julian Baggini|Value, Me, People 
It would probably surprise people to know that I'm interested in wildlife. I read a lot of poetry, too.|Sean Bean|Surprise, People, Know 
Poetry and progress are like two ambitious men who hate one another with an instinctive hatred, and when they meet upon the same road, one of them has to give place.|Charles Baudelaire|Progress, Road, Hate 
France is not poetic; she even feels, in fact, a congenital horror of poetry. Among the writers who use verse, those whom she will always prefer are the most prosaic.|Charles Baudelaire|She, Horror, France 
In traditional Asian arts, the word and the picture always sit next to each other. I have an aunt, a Chinese brush painter, who told me that when you do a Chinese brush painting, you have to pair the image up with some poetry.|Gene Luen Yang|Me, Painting, Picture 
Whether you like modern incarnations of what country radio hits are, or you like what I'm doing, or you like something really off in folk, poetry Americana land, it's all just music, man. If you like one of them, great - go buy it.|Chris Stapleton|Music, Great, Man 
So now I have a collection of poetry by Aaron Neville and I give it to people I want to share it with. I'd like to publish it someday.|Aaron Neville|People, Want, Now 
I write poetry on my iPhone. I've got about 100 poems on there.|Aaron Neville|iPhone, Write, I Write 
It's more fun to have a name rather than a number. I think this gives our products a personality. I get the names from literature, movies, opera, traveling, nature, poetry, sometimes even the street. I keep a small book that I write in. I wake up in the middle of the night and jot down a name for a lipstick or an eyeshadow.|Francois Nars|Nature, Personality, Book 
Magna Carta has become totemic. It is in the comedy of Tony Hancock, in the poetry of Kipling, never far from the front pages in a constitutional crisis.|Melvyn Bragg|Crisis, Comedy, Never 
I think poetry is a fabulous medium to encapsulate thoughts far more precisely than prose.|Kapil Sibal|Thoughts, Think, Fabulous 
I was writing poetry, and the Mountain Goats was an outgrowth of that.|John Darnielle|Mountain, Writing, Goats 
Opera combines pretty basic theater and poetry, but the storyline itself is actually quite poetic and, after some digital research, taking that actual content and seeing it as undeniably poetic.|John Darnielle|Research, Digital, Seeing 
My father would tell me if I wasn't writing in meter verse, it wasn't poetry.|John Darnielle|Father, Writing, Me 
I do think digital media encourages speed-reading, which can be fine if one is simply seeking information. But a serious novel or work of history or volume of poetry is an experience one should savor, take time over.|Michael Dirda|Work, Time, History 
Most lyric poetry is about love, whether yearned after, fulfilled, or wistfully regretted; what isn't tends to consist of laments and cris du coeur over this, that, and the other.|Michael Dirda|Love, Over, Fulfilled 
It's something we, guys, have all done. Made tapes for girls, trying to impress them, to meet them on a shared plane of aesthetics. Read them someone else's poetry because they do poetry better than you could do it, because you're too awkward to do it.|John Cusack|Trying, Better, You 
Muhammadan law in its relation to women, is a pattern to European law. Look back to the history of Islam, and you will find that women have often taken leading places - on the throne, in the battle-field, in politics, in literature, poetry, etc.|Annie Besant|History, Women, Politics 
I never really liked poetry readings; I liked to read poetry by myself, but I liked singing, chanting my lyrics to this jazz group.|Leonard Cohen|Myself, Singing, Jazz 
I always thought that poetry is the verdict that others give to a certain kind of writing. So to call yourself a poet is a kind of dangerous description. It's for others it's for others to use. |Leonard Cohen|Writing, Thought, Yourself 
I have written about some truly great writers - John Steinbeck, Robert Frost, and William Faulkner. Faulkner and Frost were the very peaks of American poetry and fiction in the 20th century.|Jay Parini|Great, American, Fiction 
I think of it this way: When you hear that people have downloaded your comic, appreciate that thousands are eager to hear what you have to say. The poetry club down the hall may not have the same problem. That's a good problem to have.|Mark Waid|Good, People, Problem 
Poetry stands or falls by its music.|John Burnside|Music, Falls, Stands 
My poems tend to be more celebratory and lyrical, and the novels so far pretty dark. Poetry doesn't seem to me to be an appropriate tool for exploring that.|John Burnside|Me, Dark, Exploring 
With fiction, I tend to get to my desk and start writing. Poetry I write in my head, often while walking, so that my poems have an organic quality, hopefully.|John Burnside|Writing, Quality, Walking 
I realised I'd spent a lot of time in my poetry trying to find a way of talking about that whereof we cannot speak.|John Burnside|Time, Speak, Trying 
I was a 16-year-old girl at one point, so of course I wrote poetry.|Elizabeth Edwards|Girl, Point, Course 
I was born in a world of opera, theatre, films, poetry, art, and therefore, out of the wire, I made a stage. That's why they call me a high wire artist.|Philippe Petit|Art, World, Artist 
I was always interested in French poetry sort of as a sideline to my own work, I was translating contemporary French poets. That kind of spilled out into translation as a way to earn money, pay for food and put bread on the table.|Paul Auster|Work, Food, Money 
I started out in life as a poet; I was only writing poetry all through my 20s. It wasn't until I was about 30 that I got serious about writing prose. While I was writing poems, I would often divert myself by reading detective novels; I liked them.|Paul Auster|Life, Myself, Writing 
Every American poet feels that the whole responsibility for contemporary poetry has fallen upon his shoulders, that he is a literary aristocracy of one.|W. H. Auden|Responsibility, American 
I think when kids just see well-crafted poetry, it's just obtuse to them. It's hard to relate to.|Jewel|Think, See, Kids 
I've always had a love for poetry and when I got signed to a record label I thought, 'How odd that I'm doing a record before a book of poetry,'|Jewel|Love, Book, Thought 
Poetry. I read Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Jane Hirschfield. I like to read Billy Collins out loud.|Amy Tan|Like, Loud, Out 
When you act, you've got to be like a poet or a musician. It's not about evidence before court. It's not a forensic subject. It's poetry; it's a completely different place.|Rhys Ifans|You, Place, Different 
You know, bad poetry I wrote in high school can still be found on the Internet, and, you know, there's a Web log of our college newspaper. You know, there's so many different stages of my creative development are sort of on-record if somebody were to choose to look for them.|Lena Dunham|School, College, Internet 
I have written some songs, but I would really call what I've done poetry at the end of the day, because I'll sit with my guitar for hours and hours on end for, like, a week and then I won't touch it for a month. I also just have no confidence. And you know what? I don't have time, because I'd rather be doing other things, like knitting.|Amanda Seyfried|Time, Day, Confidence 
I'm moving to Rio permanently with my family. It's one of the places left in the world where people still live with a big charge of poetry on a daily basis. I feel we've kind of lost that here in Europe.|Vincent Cassel|Family, Daily, World 
Every single soul is a poem.|Michael Franti|Soul, Single, Every 
A poem is true if it hangs together. Information points to something else. A poem points to nothing but itself.|E. M. Forster|Together, Information, True 
The sort of poetry I seek resides in objects man can't touch.|E. M. Forster|Man, Touch, Objects 
A definition of poetry can only determine what poetry should be and not what poetry actually was and is otherwise the most concise formula would be: Poetry is that which at some time and some place was thus named. |Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Time, Place, Which 
One has only as much morality as one has philosophy and poetry.|Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Philosophy, Morality, Only 
Women are treated as unjustly in poetry as in life. The feminine ones are not idealistic, and the idealistic not feminine.|Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Life, Women, Feminine 
From what the moderns want, we must learn what poetry should become; from what the ancients did, what poetry must be.|Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Learn, Want, Become 
Women do not have as great a need for poetry because their own essence is poetry.|Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Women, Great, Need 
Nothing truly convincing - which would possess thoroughness, vigor, and skill - has been written against the ancients as yet; especially not against their poetry.|Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Nothing, Skill, Which 
If you want to see mankind fully, look at a family. Within the family minds become organically one, and for this reason the family is total poetry.|Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Family, Want, You 
A connection between poetry and blindness is a classical trope.|Justin Cartwright|Connection, Between 
I used to spend a lot of time dreaming and writing poetry.|Mohit Chauhan|Time, Writing, Dreaming 
I think if a poet wanted to lead, he or she would want the message to be unequivocally clear and free of ambiguity. Whereas poetry is actually the home of ambiguity, ambivalence and uncertainty.|Billy Collins|Home, Free, Want 
In the long revolt against inherited forms that has by now become the narrative of 20th-century poetry in English, no poet was more flamboyant or more recognizable in his iconoclasm than Cummings.|Billy Collins|Long, Now, Become 
There are interesting forms of difficulty, and there are unprofitable forms of difficulty. I mean, I enjoy some difficult poetry, but some of it is impenetrable and I actually wouldn't want to penetrate it if I could, perhaps.|Billy Collins|Enjoy, Interesting, Want 
Listeners are kind of ambushed... if a poem just happens to be said when they're listening to the radio. The listener doesn't have time to deploy what I call their 'poetry deflector shields' that were installed in high school - there's little time to resist the poem.|Billy Collins|Time, School, Listening 
I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places - poetry on buses, poetry on subways, on billboards, on cereal boxes.|Billy Collins|Places, Pretty, Cereal 
We love, you know, children love the ingredients of poetry. And then they go into this tunnel that we call adolescence, and when they come out of it, they hate poetry.|Billy Collins|Love, Children, Hate 
I have my Poetry 180 project, which I've made my main project. We encourage high schools, because that's really where, for most people, poetry dies off and gets buried under other adolescent pursuits.|Billy Collins|People, Project, High 
I don't think anybody reads a book of poetry front to back. Editors and reviewers only. I don't think anybody else does.|Billy Collins|Book, Think, Back 
When I was a young man, I understood that poetry was two things - it was difficult to understand, but you could understand that the poet was miserable. So for a while there, I wrote poems that were hard to understand, even by me, but gave off whiffs of misery.|Billy Collins|Man, Me, You 
When I became poet laureate, I was in a slightly uncomfortable position because I think a lot of poetry isn't worth reading.|Billy Collins|Reading, Think 
For most Americans, poetry plays no role in their everyday lives. But also for most Americans, contemporary painting or jazz or sculpture play no role either. I'm not saying poetry is singled out as a special thing to ignore.|Billy Collins|Painting, Jazz, Saying 
People think of poetry as a school subject... Poetry is very frustrating to students because they don't have a taste for ambiguity, for one thing. That gives them a poetry hangover.|Billy Collins|School, People, Think 
My persona is less miserable than a lot of contemporary poetry speakers are.|Billy Collins|Miserable, Persona, Than 
I'm all for poetry catching up with technology, and just as there are iTunes, I think we should have iPoems. I mean, people should be able to walk around with their earbuds in and listening to poems on their iPod.|Billy Collins|Technology, Listening, Walk 
I find a lot of poetry very disappointing, but I do have poets that I go back to. One book of poetry that I'd like to mention is 'The Exchange' by Sophie Cabot Black. Her poems are difficult without being too difficult.|Billy Collins|Book, Black, Her 
Some honor Cummings as the granddaddy of all American innovators in poetry and ascribe to him a diverse progeny that includes virtually any poet who considers the page a field and allows silence to be part of poetry's expressiveness.|Billy Collins|Silence, American, Honor 
Few rappers realize the genre sprang from West African griots through Delta slave songs to jazz poetry and the comedic trash talk of 'the dozens.'|Quincy Jones|Jazz, Realize, Slave 
I always wrote poetry as a teenager and it was always so dark, but it made me feel good to get it out.|Pink|Good, Me, Dark 
I like poetry when I don't quite understand why I like it. Poetry isn't just a question of wrapping something up and giving it to someone else to unwrap. It just doesn't work like that.|Mark Haddon|Work, Giving, Why 
I like to write poetry.|Rebecca Ferguson|Like, Write 
I wrote things for the school's newspaper, and - like all teenagers - I dabbled in poetry.|Stephen Colbert|School, Newspaper, Teenagers 
You know that thing people say, 'poetry is the hardest, stories are the second hardest, novels are the easiest?' I'm here to tell you that novels are the hardest. Writing a novel is unbelievably difficult. It's nightmarish.|Ethan Canin|Writing, People, Know 
I love the simple poetry of theater, where you can stand in a spotlight on a stage and wrap a coat around you, and say, 'It was 1860 and it was winter...'|Gary Oldman|Love, Winter, Simple 
You don't have to live in a garage to write great poetry.|Felix Dennis|Great, Live, You 
I want to prove that if you write in strict meter and rhyme about subjects people care about, they will buy poetry.|Felix Dennis|People, Want, Care 
I am absolutely convinced that my life was redeemed by poetry.|Felix Dennis|Life, I Am, My Life 
With a poetry book I can send 100 copies out to reviewers and other people, and even do it in advance and get their response. It's difficult with iPad: how do you send it out for free, and how do you even disseminate it before it goes into their store?|Felix Dennis|Book, Free, People 
Poetry is one of the oldest of all art forms, and one of its powers for shamans and tribal leaders was the mnemonic.|Felix Dennis|Art, Leaders, Oldest 
Poetry is the experience of liberty. The poet risks himself, chances all on the poem's all with each verse he writes.|Octavio Paz|Experience, Risks, Liberty 
Poetry is not a genre in harmony with the modern world; its innermost nature is hostile or indifferent to the dogmas of modern times, progress and the cult of the future.|Octavio Paz|Nature, Future, Progress 
Poetry, whatever the manifest content of the poem, is always a violation of the rationalism and morality of bourgeois society.|Octavio Paz|Society, Morality, Content 
Any reflection about poetry should begin, or end, with this question: who and how many read poetry books?|Octavio Paz|Reflection, End, Question 
I've written for every medium except poetry, at which I suck.|J. Michael Straczynski|Suck, Which, Every 
Poetry is not an issue of form and enjambments. Poetry, as the word is classically used, has to do with sound and sense. It can be rhyme. It can be rhythm, pace, breath.|Tim O'Brien|Sound, Rhythm, Rhyme 
Sufi poetry is, in a sense, self-help poetry about how to live a decent life, how to deal with your mortality.|Mohsin Hamid|Life, Live, Sense 
Sylvia Plath, Rumi, there's a lot of spoken word poets who do a really incredible job putting their spoken work into page poetry - that's what I strive to do.|Mary Lambert|Work, Job, Page 
There is no real way to categorize McLean's 'American Pie' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock.|Douglas Brinkley|American, Rock, Pie 
That's all there was in our house: poetry and choir rehearsal and duets and so forth I listened to Dad and Mother discuss things about poetry and delivery and voice and diction - I don't think anyone could know how much it really means. |Chuck Berry|Mother, Know, Think 
My dad was the cause of me being in show business. He was not only in poetry but in acting a bit. He was Mordecai in the play 'A Dream of Queen Esther.'|Chuck Berry|Business, Queen, Me 
I love poetry. I love rhyming. Do you know, there are poets who don't rhyme? Shakespeare did not rhyme most of the time, and that's why I do not like him.|Chuck Berry|Love, Time, Know 
All I knew about Ethiopia was from a few records that I like, as well as what I read about the famine. But you get there and it's another world. It's filled with art and music and poetry and intellectuals and writers - all kinds of people.|Flea|Music, Art, World 
My dad is a Jack Nicholson lookalike and a frustrated performer, my mother's into reading and poetry. I suppose the thing I owe them most is my confidence.|Michael Sheen|Confidence, Mother, Reading 
For thousands of years, poetry has been picturing love as a mysterious and tragic power. But when anyone says the same thing in plain prose, and adds that life would be colourless and poor without the great passions, then this is called immorality!|Ellen Key|Love, Life, Great 
When the modern movement began, starting perhaps with the paintings of Manet and the poetry of Baudelaire and Rimbaud, what distinguished the modern movement was the enormous honesty that writers, painters and playwrights displayed about themselves. The bourgeois novel flinches from such notions.|J. G. Ballard|Honesty, Movement, Modern 
Poetry is what we turn to in the most emotional moments of our life - when a beloved friend dies, when a baby is born or when we fall in love.|Erica Jong|Love, Life, Baby 
Poetry is the language we speak in the most terrifying or ecstatic passages of our lives. But the very word poetry scares people. They think of their grade school teachers reciting 'Hiawatha' and they groan.|Erica Jong|School, Language, Speak 
I guess the thing that I'm most proud of is that I kept on writing poetry. I understand that poetry is sort of the source of everything I do. It's the source of my creativity.|Erica Jong|Creativity, Writing, Proud 
I thought to spend my declining years writing poetry and teaching - but that won't pay the Bergdorf's bill. I think I'll move to somewhere life is cheaper.|Erica Jong|Life, Writing, Thought 
Often I find that poems predict what I'm going to do later in my own writing, and often I find that poems predict my life. So I think poetry is the most intense expression of feeling that we have.|Erica Jong|Life, Writing, My Life 
In poetry you can express almost inexpressible feelings. You can express the pain of loss, you can express love. People always turn to poetry when someone they love dies, when they fall in love.|Erica Jong|Love, Pain, Fall 
I can't understand Urdu, Bahasa or Russian, but when the Pakistani Faiz, the Indonesian Rendra and the Russian Rosdentvensky declaim, I can feel the living throb of rhythm and music, the warmth and passion of their poetry, as do the hundreds, not a mere roomful, of poetry lovers in the audience.|F. Sionil Jose|Music, Passion, Living 
We read Robert Browning's poetry. Here we needed no guidance from the professor: the poems themselves were enough.|Carl Sandburg|Enough, Guidance, Here 
When I was writing pretty poor poetry, this girl with midnight black hair told me to go on.|Carl Sandburg|Writing, Girl, Hair 
Poetry is a phantom script telling how rainbows are made and why they go away.|Carl Sandburg|Why, Away, Go Away 
My work should be seen as poetry.|Robert Wilson|Work, Should, Seen 
The commitment to working at poetry is important because a poet is a maker, and a poem is a made thing. We have to honor our feelings by working to transform them into something meaningful and lasting.|Edward Hirsch|Commitment, Honor 
I'm a poet, and I spent my life in poetry.|Edward Hirsch|Life, My Life, Spent 
Someone who's awake in the middle of the night is a soul consciousness when everyone else is asleep, and that creates a feeling of solitude in poetry that I very much like.|Edward Hirsch|Soul, Solitude, Night 
You're shadowed by your own dream, especially as you get older, of trying to create something that will last in poetry. And so, you're working on its behalf.|Edward Hirsch|Dream, Working, You 
There have always been great defenses of poetry, and I've tried to write mine, and I think all of my work and criticism is a defense of poetry to try and keep something alive in poetry.|Edward Hirsch|Work, Great, Think 
When I taught at the University of Houston in the Creative Writing program, we required the poets to take workshops in fiction writing, and we required the fiction writers to take workshops in poetry.|Edward Hirsch|Writing, Creative 
I don't think you can read poetry while you're watching television very well.|Edward Hirsch|Television, Think, You 
The idea of how to read a poem is based on the idea that poetry needs you as a reader. That the experience of poetry, the meaning in poetry, is a kind of circuit that takes place between a poet, a poem and a reader, and that meaning doesn't exist or inhere in poems alone.|Edward Hirsch|Experience, Alone, Meaning 
There's never been a culture without poetry in the history of the world.|Edward Hirsch|History, Culture, World 
In every culture, in every language, there is expressive play, expressive word play; there's language use to different purposes that we would call poetry.|Edward Hirsch|Culture, Language, Play 
I don't think poetry will die, but I think that poetry does demand a certain kind of attention to language. It does demand a certain space in order to read it, and I think that space is somewhat threatened by the lack of attention that people have and the amount of time that they give to things.|Edward Hirsch|Time, Space, Language 
I had feelings that I didn't know what to do with, and I felt better when I started writing them. I thought of it as poetry. I did notice girls really liked it. Better than football. They liked the combination.|Edward Hirsch|Football, Writing, Thought 
I'd say people do need some help with poetry because I think poetry just helps takes us to places that Americans aren't always accustomed to going.|Edward Hirsch|People, Help, Think 
I find great consolation in having a lot of poetry books around. I believe that writing poetry and reading it are deeply intertwined. I've always delighted in the company of the poets I've read.|Edward Hirsch|Great, Writing, Reading 
As long as there's been poetry, there have been lamentations.|Edward Hirsch|Long, Been 
Poetry is a form of necessary speech... I have sought to restore the aura of sacred practice that accompanies true poetic creation, to honor both the rational and the irrational elements of poetry.|Edward Hirsch|Honor, Practice, Speech 
Poetry is meant to inspire readers and listeners, to connect them more deeply to themselves even as it links them more fully to others. But many people feel put off by the terms of poetry, its odd vocabulary, its notorious difficulty.|Edward Hirsch|Inspire, People, Connect 
The terms of poetry - some simple, some complicated, some ancient, some new - should bring us closer to what we're hearing, enlarging our experience of it, enabling us to describe what we're reading, to feel and think with greater precision.|Edward Hirsch|Experience, Reading, Simple 
The line is a way of framing poetry. All verse is measured by lines. The poetic line immediately announces its difference from everyday speech and prose.|Edward Hirsch|Speech, Way, Lines 
The sense of flowing, which is so crucial to song, is also crucial to poetry.|Edward Hirsch|Song, Sense, Which 
When poetry separates from song, then the words have to carry all the rhythm themselves; they have to do all the work. They can't rely on the singing voice.|Edward Hirsch|Work, Words, Singing 
One of the things that distinguishes poetry from ordinary speech is that in a very few number of words, poetry captures some kind of deep feeling, and rhythm is the way to get there. Rhythm is the way the poetry carries itself.|Edward Hirsch|Deep, Words, Speech 
I started writing poetry as a teenager in suburban Chicago out of emotional desperation.|Edward Hirsch|Writing, Chicago, Emotional 
I grew up in a middle-class house without books, without art. No one around me wrote poetry or even read it.|Edward Hirsch|Art, Me, House 
Poetry itself hasn't been well served by poets who fled to the margins.|Edward Hirsch|Well, Itself, Margins 
I aspire to a poetry of great formal integrity, deep passion and high intellect, and I have many models for how to do that.|Edward Hirsch|Integrity, Deep, Great 
I'm so happy to be an advocate for poetry.|Edward Hirsch|Happy, Advocate 
I didn't read poetry seriously until college, when I really began to devour it in a very intense way. I also discovered that a poet is a maker. Before that, I thought a poet was someone who wrote about his own experiences.|Edward Hirsch|College, Thought, Seriously 
The idea that a poem was a made thing stayed with me, and I decided then that I wanted to be an artist, not just a diarist. So I put myself through a kind of apprenticeship in writing poetry, and I understood even then that my practice as a poet was deeply related to my reading.|Edward Hirsch|Myself, Writing, Artist 
Poetry is a vocation. It is not a career but a calling.|Edward Hirsch|Career, Vocation, Calling 
Writing poetry is such an intense experience that it helps to start the process in a casual or wayward frame of mind.|Edward Hirsch|Experience, Writing, Mind 
Poetry takes place in time. It is a durational. Things take place in sequence.|Edward Hirsch|Time, Place, Things 
Poetry, being supremely useless, by its very existence represents a protest against the so-called 'real world' of busy-ness and moneymaking, so we must embrace, salute and support our poets.|Tom Hodgkinson|Support, World, Existence 
I didn't start off as a journalist; I started off as a poet. My ambition was to practise poetry. Then I found journalism, but that other voice never fled from me.|Ta-Nehisi Coates|Ambition, Me, Journalism 
One thing I do know is that poetry, to be understood, must be clear.|Mary Oliver|Know, Clear, Must 
People want poetry. They need poetry. They get it. They don't want fancy work.|Mary Oliver|Work, People, Want 
Poetry is meant to be heard.|Mary Oliver|Meant To Be, Heard, Meant 
You know, in my music career there was a moment where the irony was just so heavy. There were people in my audience that were the reason I developed neuroses. These people that tortured my life were using my art, my poetry, as fuel for them, to torture other people.|Fred Durst|Life, Music, Art 
I really enjoy English and poetry and writing classes.|Taylor Momsen|Writing, Enjoy, English 
All one's inventions are true, you can be sure of that. Poetry is as exact a science as geometry.|Gustave Flaubert|Science, True, You 
Poetry is something to make us wiser and better, by continually revealing those types of beauty and truth, which God has set in all men's souls.|James Russell Lowell|Beauty, Truth, God 
As the years pass, I find that writers who were once central to me aren't anymore. I revered Yeats's poetry in college. I respect it now and am still ravished by certain lines, but I don't go back to him again and again. I do go back to Emily Dickinson again and again.|Margo Jefferson|Respect, College, Me 
Popular music is one endless love song that, I suspect, the basically solitary Ella Fitzgerald approached much as the basically solitary Marianne Moore approached poetry: reading it with a certain contempt for it, Moore said, you could find a place in it for the genuine.|Margo Jefferson|Love, Music, Reading 
Fiction is supposed to be immersive and supposed to be entertaining and narrative, so structures have to be buried a little bit. If they come foregrounded too much, it stops being fiction and starts being poetry - something more concrete and out of time.|Eleanor Catton|Time, Too Much, Little 
Poetry was one of the things that interested me most as I was growing up. I used to write it in my head all the time. I still think the very greatest pleasure in life is to write a poem.|Claire Tomalin|Life, Time, Me 
'Words and Music' on Radio 3 is always a treat. Actors read passages of poetry and prose interspersed with music, and nobody tells you what it is. Later you can look it up online, but at the time you can't cheat.|Claire Tomalin|Music, Time, Words 
I read usually in the morning, in my kitchen at breakfast - a short reading time, usually poetry. I read in bed every night. I usually get in bed pretty early with a book, and I read until I can't prop my eyes open anymore - sometimes rather late.|Sue Monk Kidd|Morning, Time, Eyes 
Country music especially can get very formulaic - you know, you have to have your verses and a bridge and a chorus, and a lot of the songs are written as just plain and simple poetry on the road.|Sturgill Simpson|Music, Road, Simple 
Poetry is the hardest thing that there is. It fascinates me, so I want to write more of it.|Steve Earle|Me, Want, The Hardest Thing 
Gregory Corso used to get really pissed when people called Bob Dylan a 'poet.' After writing poetry for a few years, I can understand that.|Steve Earle|Writing, People, I Can 
Becoming interested in poetics got me interested in theater. Theater is supposed to be poetry, you know, before it's anything else. It just doesn't fly if it isn't musical.|Steve Earle|Me, Fly, Know 
I wrote poetry, which got me into lyrics. Stevie Wonder, Carole King, Elton John pulled me into pop. I started singing with a band - just for fun - when I was 17. And pretty soon, I was thinking I could sing pop in English as well as Spanish.|Gloria Estefan|Thinking, Fun, Me 
Is there any purpose to translating poetry? A poem does not contain information of importance, like a signpost or a warning notice.|James Buchan|Purpose, Information, Like 
I used to buy scented poetry books on tour and read aloud to the band. Not what you'd expect, huh?|Suzi Quatro|You, Band, Expect 
There was no market for poetry about trauma, abuse, loss, love, and healing through the lens of a Punjabi-Sikh immigrant woman.|Rupi Kaur|Love, Woman, Healing 
I would give anything to sing like Beyonce or Adele. I've said many times to my friends that if I could sing like them, I would give up poetry and writing.|Rupi Kaur|Friends, Writing, Said 
Poetry and art are key influences in changing how we look at taboos.|Rupi Kaur|Art, Key, Look 
'Milk and Honey' was written with me being honest to myself, kind of pulling at the things that I hear the most and saying that out loud, and you know, that thing that we hear the most is most universal, and so that rings true with all folks. The language used in the poetry is extremely, extremely accessible.|Rupi Kaur|Myself, Language, Me 
For me, the power of the poetry in 'Milk and Honey' is the feeling you get after finished reading the poem. It's the emotion you feel once you've read the last word, and that is only possible when the diction is easy, and you don't get stuck on every other word, you don't know what the word means.|Rupi Kaur|Power, Reading, Me 
'Hamilton' is, of course, closely tied to the Obamas because Lin first performed the opening number at a White House poetry jam.|Phillipa Soo|First, House, Opening 
I was one of those dark, quiet kids that wrote poetry.|Rick Springfield|Dark, Quiet, Kids 
When superstition is allowed to perform the task of old age in dulling the human temperament, we can say goodbye to all excellence in poetry, in painting, and in music.|Denis Diderot|Music, Age, Excellence 
When I arrived at Columbia, I gave up acting and became interested in all things French. French poetry, French history, French literature.|Joseph Gordon-Levitt|History, Acting, Literature 
Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.|Ed Koch|Art, People, Paint 
You can be intuitive when you've got a more expansive role. You can get into the poetry of telling the story rather than just pushing buttons.|Willem Dafoe|Story, You, Role 
As I grew older - collapsing into my seventies, glimpsing ahead the cliffs of the eighties, colliding into eighty-five - poetry abandoned me.|Donald Hall|Me, Ahead, Older 
Prose is not so dependent on sound. The line of poetry, with the breaking of the line - to me, sound is the kind of doorway into poetry. And my sense of sound, or my ability to control it, lapsed or grew less.|Donald Hall|Control, Me, Kind 
After a couple of years of public high school, I went to Exeter - an insane conglomeration of adolescent males in the wilderness, all of whom claimed to hate poetry.|Donald Hall|School, Hate, High School 
I loathe the trivialization of poetry that happens in creative writing classes. Teachers set exercises to stimulate subject matter: Write a poem about an imaginary landscape with real people in it. Write about a place your parents lived in before you were born. We have enough terrible poetry around without encouraging more of it.|Donald Hall|Parents, Writing, Creative 
I've always felt that poetry was particularly erotic, more than prose was... I say that you read poems not with your eyes and not with your ears, but with your mouth. You taste it.|Donald Hall|Eyes, You, Mouth 
For better or worse, poetry is my life.|Donald Hall|Life, My Life, Better 
Sound had always been my portal to poetry, but in the beginning, sound was imagined through the eye.|Donald Hall|Eye, Beginning, Through 
Poetry is what I've done my whole life. And every important thing in my life had found itself into poems.|Donald Hall|Life, My Life, Important 
In my life, I've seen enormous increase in the consumption of poetry. When I was young, there were virtually no poetry readings.|Donald Hall|Life, My Life, Young 
Poetry offers works of art that are beautiful, like paintings, which are my second favorite work of the art, but there are also works of art that embody emotion and that are kind of school for feeling. They teach how to feel, and they do this by the means of their beauty of language.|Donald Hall|Work, Art, Beauty 
I was at Harvard with a whole bunch of poets, and that was very rare. They published a lot of books because there was an excitement after the war that translated into poetry.|Donald Hall|War, Excitement, Rare 
When it comes to poetry, I think partly the numbers of people attempting to write poems is probably a result or the reaction to technology.|Donald Hall|Technology, People, Think 
Every afternoon, I shut the door of my bedroom to write: Poetry was secret, dangerous, wicked and delicious.|Donald Hall|Door, Dangerous, Secret 
A song is a short composition for voice and instruments. It is a piece of sung poetry set to music. It is usually only a few minutes long.|Russell Smith|Music, Short, Long 
Poetry has been to me its own exceeding great reward it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me. |Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Beautiful, Good, Great 
I always loved singing and writing poetry. I always loved music, and I've loved writing my whole life. When I put them together, it was probably in my early 20s where I put words to music for the first time.|Lisa Marie Presley|Life, Music, Time 
When poetry is on the money, 12 words can slay you. I admire that greatly.|Daniel Woodrell|Money, Words, You 
I'm very attracted to poetry for all the reasons someone likes poetry. The notion of compression seems to fit my personality.|Daniel Woodrell|Personality, Seems, Someone 
I read a little bit of nonfiction and a lot of poetry. I think of poetry as my shot of whiskey when I don't have time to savor a whole bottle of wine.|Alice McDermott|Time, Wine, Think 
The language of the Catholic Church - the liturgy, the prayer, the gospels - was in many ways my first poetry.|Alice McDermott|Prayer, Language, Church 
I believed in fictional characters as if they were a part of real life. Poetry was important, too. My parents had memorized poems from their days attending school in New York City and loved reciting them. We all enjoyed listening to these poems and to music as well.|Alice McDermott|Life, Music, Parents 
Making love is, simply put, poetry in motion.|Wale|Love, Love Is, Motion 
I always read poetry before I write, to sensitize me to the rhythms and music of language.|Janet Fitch|Music, Language, Me 
History gives you insight of the same quality of truth as poetry or philosophy or a novel.|Simon Schama|History, Truth, Quality 
Somehow, the words don't have any vitality, any life to them, unless I can feel it marking on a paper. That's how I start. Once I'm off, then I switch to the laptop. I think it would all just be prose if it started on a laptop - not that what I do is poetry.|Simon Schama|Life, Words, Start 
As a schoolboy, poetry seemed defined by preciousness. It was all very rarefied.|Simon Schama|Defined, Very, Seemed 
The difficulty with poetry is that it doesn't have the life that Shakespeare or Jane Austen have beyond the page. You can't make a costume drama out of it. There's no place for it to go except trapped inside its little book.|Simon Schama|Life, Book, Page 
The library was open for one hour after school let out. I hid there, looking at art books and reading poetry.|Lynda Barry|Art, School, Reading 
Dancing is the poetry of the foot.|John Dryden|Foot, Dancing 
Poetry is so vital to us until school spoils it.|Russell Baker|School, Us, Until 
Anticipating that most poetry will be worse than carrying heavy luggage through O'Hare Airport, the public, to its loss, reads very little of it.|Russell Baker|Loss, Through, Little 
I think the novel is not so much a literary genre, but a literary space, like a sea that is filled by many rivers. The novel receives streams of science, philosophy, poetry and contains all of these; it's not simply telling a story.|Jose Saramago|Science, Sea, Space 
Nothing is too small. Nothing is too, quote-unquote, ordinary or insignificant. Those are the things that make up the measure of our days, and they're the things that sustain us. And they're the things that certainly can become worthy of poetry.|Rita Dove|Small, Measure, Nothing 
I try to show what it is about language and music that enthralls, because I think those are the two elements of poetry.|Rita Dove|Music, Language, Think 
There are distinct duties of a poet laureate. I plan a reading series at the Library of Congress and advise the librarian. The rest is how I want to promote poetry.|Rita Dove|Reading, Plan, Library 
I was apprehensive. I feared every time I talked about poetry, it would be filtered through the lens of race, sex, and age.|Rita Dove|Time, Age, Through 
I see a resurgence of interest in poetry. I am less optimistic about the prospects for the arts when it comes to federal funding.|Rita Dove|I Am, See, Interest 
The poetry that sustains me is when I feel that, for a minute, the clouds have parted and I've seen ecstasy or something.|Rita Dove|Clouds, Me, Feel 
I think one of the things that people tend to forget is that poets do write out of life. It isn't some set piece that then gets put up on the shelf, but that the impetus, the real instigation for poetry is everything that's happening around us.|Rita Dove|Life, People, Think 
Not too many people know it, but when I was in junior high, I was a pretty tough kid and was the leader of a street gang. Well, OK, it was less a street gang than an Ecology Club. We were pretty intimidating, though, and had our own meeting room until we got run out of there by a bunch of thugs from the Poetry Society.|W. Bruce Cameron|Leader, Society, People 
I want to be the best advocate and promoter for poetry that I can be.|Natasha Trethewey|Best, Want, I Can 
From the catbird seat, I've found poetry to be the necessary utterance it has always been in America.|Natasha Trethewey|America, Always, Found 
Dismissals of poetry are nothing new. It's easy to dismiss poetry if one has not read much of it.|Natasha Trethewey|Easy, Nothing, New 
The first thing I tried to do in the months after losing my mother was to write a poem. I found myself turning to poetry in the way so many people do - to make sense of losses. And I wrote pretty bad poems about it. But it did feel that the poem was the only place that could hold this grief.|Natasha Trethewey|Myself, Mother, Grief 
I think I felt at some point that I couldn't understand poetry or that it was beyond me or it didn't speak to my experience. I think that was because I hadn't yet found the right poems to invite me in.|Natasha Trethewey|Experience, Speak, Me 
My father, Eric Trethewey, is a poet, so I had one right inside the house. And on long trips, he'd tell me, if I got bored in the car, to write a poem about it. And I did find that poetry was a way for me, I think as it for a lot of people, to articulate those things that seem hardest to say.|Natasha Trethewey|Car, Father, Me 
I think poetry's always a kind of faith. It is the kind that I have.|Natasha Trethewey|Faith, Think, Kind 
Even though I am the daughter of a poet, and my stepmother is also a poet, growing up, I didn't think I could understand poetry; I didn't think that it had any relevance to my life, the feelings that I endured on a day-to-day basis, until I was introduced to the right poem.|Natasha Trethewey|Life, Daughter, I Am 
I think people turn to poetry more often than they think they do, or encounter it in more ways than they think that they do. I think we forget the places that we encounter it, say, in songs or in other little bits and pieces of things that we may have remembered from childhood.|Natasha Trethewey|Childhood, People, Think 
I think the biggest thing that I have to do is to remind people that poetry is there for us to turn to not only to remind us that we're not alone - for example, if we are grieving the loss of someone - but also to help us celebrate our joys. That's why so many people I know who've gotten married will have a poem read at the wedding.|Natasha Trethewey|Alone, Wedding, Celebrate 
Poetry's a thing that belongs to everyone.|Natasha Trethewey|Everyone, Belongs, Thing 
'NewsHour' is very interested in poetry, but they're also interested in not just that something's cute to add on at the end of their programming, but something that actually is integrated into the news.|Natasha Trethewey|Cute, End, News 
I've been most happy to be an advocate for the kinds of grassroots things that people are doing who care about poetry.|Natasha Trethewey|Happy, People, Care 
I like the beauty of Faulkner's poetry. But I don't like his themes, not at all.|Manuel Puig|Beauty, Like, Themes 
I spent many years of my life as an economist and demographer. I was finally distracted by writing my novels and poetry. I'm enormously happy that was the case. I feel that with writing I have found my metier.|Vikram Seth|Life, Happy, Writing 
You have to learn a few things, which you do along the way, but basically, poetry is a matter of the ear. Iambic pentameters or what constitutes a stanza comes naturally - your ears will know.|Vikram Seth|Learn, Know, You 
Why do writers, say, give up a job in economics and decide to write poetry? Or, why do they give up a job in a bank and decide to paint, like Krishan Khanna? They want to convey something.|Vikram Seth|Job, Economics, Want 
Everyone sort of sees his own life and times as being ephemeral. One thinks that everything good or important that happened, happened in the past. But I think that seeing scenes that you are used to, but with the heightening effects of poetry, perhaps makes you value your life and times more than you might otherwise do.|Vikram Seth|Life, Good, Past 
Those books of mine that are remunerative - I'm not talking about poetry here - take years to write, and I am never sure they'll be successful. So writing is a risk in more senses than one.|Vikram Seth|I Am, Writing, Successful 
You know, I can imagine not writing a novel and writing poetry only.|Vikram Seth|Writing, Know, You 
The Lord's Prayer is the most perfect piece of poetry. I always feel at peace and moved when I recite it.|Mary Quant|Peace, Prayer, Perfect 
The poet doesn't invent. He listens.|Jean Cocteau|Poet, Listens, He 
A true poet does not bother to be poetical. Nor does a nursery gardener scent his roses.|Jean Cocteau|Roses, True, Scent 
Poetry is indispensable - if I only knew what for.|Jean Cocteau|Only, Knew, Indispensable 
The sentences I write have their roots in song and poetry, and take their bearings from music and painting, as much as from the need to impart mere information, or mirror anything. I am not a realist writer, even if I seem like one.|Colm Toibin|Music, I Am, Mirror 
Thinking in its lower grades, is comparable to paper money, and in its higher forms it is a kind of poetry.|Havelock Ellis|Money, Thinking, Kind 
When I was in college, I used to write little ditties and short stories and poetry for my friends. Writing a book is another thing. It is so much different from my traditional day of dirty fingernails and greasy hair and hot pans.|Mario Batali|Day, Friends, College 
I actually remember celebrating National Poetry Day at school I remember having to write and read a load. |Tinie Tempah|Day, School, Remember 
Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.|Terry Eagleton|Age, Political, Back 
Poetry is the most subtle of the literary arts, and students grow more ingenious by the year at avoiding it. If they can nip around Milton, duck under Blake and collapse gratefully into the arms of Jane Austen, a lot of them will.|Terry Eagleton|Grow, Duck, Students 
When I started writing poetry, it was always in very hip-hop influenced spaces: Someone would teach a Nas song side-by-side with a Gwendolyn Brooks poem, and we'd talk about the connections between those things.|Jamila Woods|Writing, Song, Connections 
I have a band called M&O. We were working on our first album in 2011 or 2012. We were looking for people to collaborate with, and I met Chance through a Young Chicago Authors poetry slam.|Jamila Woods|Chance, People, Looking 
It was through poetry I learned just to appreciate my own voice and to not think of my voice in terms of what it needs to be able to do, but what it can do.|Jamila Woods|Voice, Appreciate, Think 
My artistic manifesto exists in the world as poetry. So even though most of the things that I've done have been on other people's projects or could be pigeonholed in certain ways, that's not how I perceive myself.|Jamila Woods|Myself, World, People 
I really liked 'Blk Girl Art.' It's like a manifesto saying why I create, whether it's poetry or music.|Jamila Woods|Music, Art, Girl 
If a poem is not memorable, there's probably something wrong. One of the problems of free verse is that much of the free verse poetry is not memorable.|Robert Morgan|Problems, Free, Memorable 
I think that it's more likely that in my 60s and 70s I will be writing poetry rather than fiction.|Robert Morgan|Writing, Think, Will 
I did not have a very literary background. I came to poetry from the sciences and mathematics, and also through an interest in Japanese and Chinese poetry in translation.|Robert Morgan|Mathematics, Through 
You have to really dive deep back into yourself and get rid of so much modern analytical categorization. It's one of the great things poetry does.|Robert Morgan|Deep, Great, Yourself 
The great watershed of modern poetry is French, more than English.|Robert Morgan|Great, Modern, Than 
Among the American contemporaries I read with most enjoyment are several North Carolinians. I think the best poetry being written these days is being written by Southerners.|Robert Morgan|Best, American, Think 
The Language Poets are writing only about language itself. The Ashbery poets are writing only about poetry itself. That seems to me a kind of dead end.|Robert Morgan|Writing, Language, Me 
Poetry, almost by definition, calls attention to its language and form.|Robert Morgan|Language, Attention, Almost 
The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.|Robert Morgan|Decision, Reading, Almost 
Teaching writing over the years intrudes on your own writing in important ways, taking away some of the excitement of poetry.|Robert Morgan|Writing, Important, Years 
I don't think poetry is something that can be taught. We can encourage young writers, but what you can't teach them is the very essence of poetry.|Robert Morgan|Think, Young, You 
I don't think the creative writing industry has helped American poetry.|Robert Morgan|Writing, American, Creative 
Some people swear by writing courses, but whether it really helps American poetry, I have doubts.|Robert Morgan|Writing, American, People 
I don't think American poetry has gotten any better in the past 35 years. Oddly enough, creative writing programs seem to have been good for fiction, and I would not have predicted that.|Robert Morgan|Good, Writing, Past 
I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale.|Robert Morgan|Love, Time, Words 
One of the most powerful devices of poetry is the use of distortions. You can go from talking about the way a minute passes to the way a century passes, or a lifetime.|Robert Morgan|Powerful, Way, You 
A poem in form still has to have voice, gesture, a sense of discovery, a metaphoric connection, as any poetry does.|Robert Morgan|Voice, Discovery, Connection 
The fact that something is in a rhymed form or in blank verse will not make it good poetry.|Robert Morgan|Good, Will, Fact 
What actually makes poetry poetry is of course impossible to define. We recognize it when we hear it, when we see it, but we can't define it.|Robert Morgan|Impossible, See, Recognize 
The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.|Robert Morgan|Art, Me, Idea 
Part of what we love about poetry is the fact that it seems ancient, that it has an authority of ancient language and ancient form, and that it's timeless, that it reaches back.|Robert Morgan|Love, Language, Authority 
I learned to impersonate the kind of person that talks about poetry. It comes from teaching, I think.|Robert Morgan|Think, Kind, Person 
And, I mean, I think poetry does need to be met to some extent, especially, I guess, 19th century poetry, and for me, it's just been so worth the effort. It's like I'm planting a garden in my head.|Jane Campion|Effort, Me, Garden 
As for how criticism of Keats' poetry relates to criticism of my own work, I'll leave that for others to decide.|Jane Campion|Work, Criticism, My Own 
I have to admit that I had a lot of problems with poetry.|Jane Campion|Problems, Admit, Lot 
Poetry, especially traditional Iranian poetry, is very good at looking at things from a number of different angles simultaneously.|Asghar Farhadi|Good, Looking, Angles 
My feeling is that poetry will wither on the vine if you don't regularly come back to the simplest fundamentals of the poem: rhythm, rhyme, simple subjects - love, death, war.|James Fenton|Love, Death, War 
Lyric poetry is, of course, musical in origin. I do know that what happened to poetry in the twentieth century was that it began to be written for the page. When it's a question of typography, why not? Poets have done beautiful things with typography - Apollinaire's 'Calligrammes,' that sort of thing.|James Fenton|Beautiful, Know, Page 
English poetry begins whenever we decide to say the modern English language begins, and it extends as far as we decide to say that the English language extends.|James Fenton|Language, English Language 
Some people think that English poetry begins with the Anglo-Saxons. I don't, because I can't accept that there is any continuity between the traditions of Anglo-Saxon poetry and those established in English poetry by the time of, say, Shakespeare. And anyway, Anglo-Saxon is a different language, which has to be learned.|James Fenton|Time, Language, People 
When we study Shakespeare on the page, for academic purposes, we may require all kinds of help. Generally, we read him in modern spelling and with modern punctuation, and with notes. But any poetry that is performed - from song lyric to tragic speech - must make its point, as it were, without reference back.|James Fenton|Song, Help, Page 
Composers need words, but they do not necessarily need poetry. The Russian composer, Aleksandr Mossolov, who chose texts from newspaper small ads, had a good point to make. With revolutionary music, any text can be set to work.|James Fenton|Work, Music, Good 
A glance at the history of European poetry is enough to inform us that rhyme itself is not indispensable. Latin poetry in the classical age had no use for it, and the kind of Latin poetry that does rhyme - as for instance the medieval 'Carmina Burana' - tends to be somewhat crude stuff in comparison with the classical verse that doesn't.|James Fenton|History, Age, Rhyme 
Great poetry does not have to be technically intricate.|James Fenton|Great, Intricate, Does 
The iambic pentameter owes its pre-eminence in English poetry to its genius for variation. Good blank verse does not sound like a series of identically measured lines. It sounds like a series of subtle variations on the same theme.|James Fenton|Good, Genius, Lines 
The voice is raised, and that is where poetry begins. And even today, in the prolonged aftermath of modernism, in places where 'open form' or free verse is the orthodoxy, you will find a memory of that raising of the voice in the term 'heightened speech.'|James Fenton|Today, Memory, Free 
One problem we face comes from the lack of any agreed sense of how we should be working to train ourselves to write poetry.|James Fenton|Train, Problem, Working 
In the writing of poetry we never know anything for sure. We will never know if we have 'trained' or 'practised' enough. We will never be able to say that we have reached grade eight, or that we have left the grades behind and are now embarked on an advanced training.|James Fenton|Training, Writing, Know 
In the winter of 1940, 'The Atlantic Monthly' invited Peter Viereck, a twenty-three-year-old Harvard graduate who had won the college's top essay and poetry prizes, to write about 'the meaning of young liberalism for the present age.'|Tom Reiss|Age, Winter, College 
Poetry always, always, always is a key piece of democracy.|Eileen Myles|Democracy, Key, Always 
As things get worse, poetry gets better because it becomes more necessary.|Eileen Myles|Better, Worse, Things 
I wasn't afraid of being poor. I didn't want to live in a big house. I'm the perfect size for poetry. I can move around.|Eileen Myles|Live, Want, Perfect 
In Arlington, people would laugh at you if you tried to get people to look at your drawings or listen to your poetry. It was like you thought you were special.|Eileen Myles|Thought, People, Laugh 
Poetry from the bottom up is an act of selection: you kind of feel your way through the crowds of poems. The good ones came forward a long time ago, and the bad ones fell away.|Eileen Myles|Time, Good, Long 
Poetry and novels are lists of our devotions. We love the feel of making the marks as the feelings are rising and falling.|Eileen Myles|Love, Falling, Feelings 
Prose, poetry, and drawings stand side by side in a very democratic way in my work.|Gunter Grass|Work, Stand, Way 
I'd park myself in the bookstore and read with one eye on everyone coming in. I remember reading a Robert Bly book of poetry.|Sally Mann|Myself, Reading, Book 
I lived a pretty chaotic life. I went to England, and I moved around, and there were a lot of things that I was interested in. I wrote poetry. I took photographs. I was a musician and all sorts of things. Nothing brilliant, but I did all these different things.|Pawel Pawlikowski|Life, Nothing, Brilliant 
Watching and learning from the great Josette Bushell-Mingo, who was playing Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra at the time, and then to return to the same stage six months later playing a lead role, was incredible - I fell in love with the poetry and the breadth of the language so much that I didn't want it to end.|Gugu Mbatha-Raw|Love, Time, Learning 
I never thought I'd be doing poetry books. I never really studied poetry. But the first one I did was after my mother died, and I realized that people sort of think and talk about her style and fashion, but in fact, what made her the person she was was really her love of reading and ideas.|Caroline Kennedy|Love, Mother, Reading 
Poetry is really a way of sharing feelings and ideas.|Caroline Kennedy|Ideas, Sharing, Feelings 
The biggest problem is people are afraid of poetry, think they can't understand it or that it will be boring.|Caroline Kennedy|People, Problem, Think 
The mystical poetry of William Blake's artwork also forms the basis for the album cover.|Bruce Dickinson|Mystical, Album, Cover 
Perhaps no person can be a poet, or even enjoy poetry, without a certain unsoundness of mind.|Thomas Babington Macaulay|Mind, Enjoy, Person 
As civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.|Thomas Babington Macaulay|Civilization, Almost 
I liked Yeats! That wild Irishman. I really loved his love of language, his flow. His chaotic ideas seemed to me just the right thing for a poet. Passion! He was always on the right side. He may be wrongheaded, but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.|Chinua Achebe|Love, Beautiful, Passion 
I was trained as an actress. But I wasn't a very convincing actress, so I started doing punk poetry and then fell into doing stand-up.|Jenny Eclair|Punk, Doing, Actress 
When I was in college, I wrote poetry very seriously, and then once I had started writing short stories, I didn't go back to poetry, partially because I felt like I understood how incredibly difficult it was.|Elizabeth McCracken|College, Writing, Short 
Poetry is often the art of overhearing yourself say things you didn't know you knew. It is a learned skill to force yourself to articulate your life, your present world or your possibilities for the future.|David Whyte|Life, Art, Future 
There's a fierce practicality and empiricism which the whole imaginative, lyrical aspect of poetry comes from.|David Whyte|Fierce, Whole, Which 
Poetry is a street fighter. It has sharp elbows. It can look after itself. Poetry can't be used for manipulation it's why you never see good poetry in advertising. |David Whyte|Good, Advertising, Why 
By definition, poetry works with qualities and dynamics that mainstream society is reluctant to face head-on. It's an interesting phenomenon that by necessity, poetry is just below the radar.|David Whyte|Society, Interesting, Face 
It is the province of poetry to be more realistic and present than the artificial narratives of an outer discourse, and not afraid of the truthful difficulty of the average human life.|David Whyte|Life, Present, Human 
Poetry carries the imagery which is large enough for the kind of life we want for ourselves.|David Whyte|Life, Want, Kind 
Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.|Wislawa Szymborska|Writing, Ring, Born 
Poetic talent doesn't operate in a vacuum. There is a spirit of Polish poetry.|Wislawa Szymborska|Talent, Spirit, Vacuum 
Everyone needs solitude, especially a person who is used to thinking about what she experiences. Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.|Wislawa Szymborska|Work, Respect, Good 
Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.|Wislawa Szymborska|Work, Respect, Good 
Thomas Davis was a great man where poetry is concerned, and a better than Thomas Moore. All over Ireland his poetry is, and he would have done other things but that he died young.|Lady Gregory|Great, Man, Great Man 
I'm not a great poetry fan.|Rupert Everett|Great, Fan 
Colloquial poetry is to the real art as the barber's wax dummy is to sculpture.|Ezra Pound|Art, Sculpture, Barber 
And New York is the most beautiful city in the world? It is not far from it. No urban night is like the night there... Squares after squares of flame, set up and cut into the aether. Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will.|Ezra Pound|Beautiful, Stars, World 
In my late teenage years, I developed a real passion for it, and wrote a lot of poetry.|Danielle Steel|Passion, Late, Real 
Reading a piece of poetry with no beat in front of 20 people is way more challenging than rocking for 10,000 people.|Macklemore|Reading, People, Way 
I read, read enormously on all different fields of Islamic thought, from philosophy to Islamic literature, poetry, exegeses, knowledge of the Hadith, the teachings of the prophet. That's how I trained myself. And then I was appointed imam by a Sufi master from Istanbul, Turkey.|Feisal Abdul Rauf|Knowledge, Myself 
I think going from doing TV and straight plays to Shakespeare is weird enough because you have this heightened language, and you are telling a story through metric poetry. But I think music is that place beyond poetry.|Tamsin Greig|Music, Language, Weird 
Poetry always runs away from you - it's very difficult to grasp it, and every time you read it, depending on your conditions, you will have a different grasp of it. Whereas with a novel, once you have read it, you have grasped it.|Abbas Kiarostami|Time, You, Difficult 
My favourite room in my house is easily the top room, which is a bedroom but also a bathroom, with a big, wooden carved bath, two huge fireplaces and a raised bit in the corner for performances. I've had some really lovely parties and poetry readings up there.|Deborah Moggach|Lovely, House, Bath 
I know I'm not a wordsmith. And I don't write poetry. Sometimes I think I should, because it's really helpful. But I always wanted to write novels.|Candace Bushnell|Know, Think, Sometimes 
I definitely used to write a lot at school. Comic poetry and drawings about people.|Sally Phillips|School, People, Comic 
Poetry is for me Eucharistic. You take someone else's suffering into your body, their passion comes into your body, and in doing that you commune, you take communion, you make a community with others.|Mary Karr|Community, Passion, Me 
Poetry privileges music and is aesthetically more challenging. Prose privileges information and is emotionally more challenging.|Mary Karr|Music, Information 
Prose cannot compete with the economy of poetry, the ability to have a full artistic experience in a short period of time.|Mary Karr|Time, Experience, Short 
Hebrew as a contemporary language, especially for poetry, is no longer the language of the Bible; but neither is it not the language of the Bible.|Cynthia Ozick|Language, Bible 
I'm conscious of a series of circles working its way through my life. And at this particular moment I have come round to the beginning of my writing cycle. It begins with poetry. There's hardly a day that goes past on which I don't write poetry.|Ben Okri|Life, Day, Past 
I began my writing life as a poet, so poetry has always been fundamental. I evolved from poetry to journalism to stories to novels. But poetry was always there.|Ben Okri|Life, Writing, Journalism 
I've been writing since I was 10 or 11. I started with poetry because that was the easiest thing. It just kind of came naturally. I think at that time West Coast hip hop was huge; all these kids around me were like, 'I want to be a rapper.' But I'm a white girl, not going to be a rapper.|Sasha Grey|Time, Writing, Girl 
I've always loved the poetry in 'Pale Fire.' I think it's wonderful.|Jonathan Galassi|Fire, Loved, Think 
Poetry is really about your mental state or intellectual, and where you are, and you're trying to evoke that, explain it to yourself, whatever, you're trying to dig into it, analyse yourself.|Jonathan Galassi|Yourself, Trying, You 
I think poetry was always where I went to deal with my deepest feelings.|Jonathan Galassi|Think, Feelings, Deepest 
I've always used poetry to explain myself to myself. These things just sat in my psyche and then came out.|Jonathan Galassi|Myself, Explain, Always 
I love poetry; it's my primary literary interest, and I suppose the kind of reading you do when you are reading poems - close reading - can carry over into how you read other things.|Jonathan Galassi|Love, Reading, You 
Poetry is not mainstream, but then neither is serious fiction, really. But I don't think there's a lot to worry about in this particular 'problem'. Why does art have to be mainstream to be significant?|Jonathan Galassi|Art, Worry, Problem 
I think poetry should be read very much like prose, except that the line breaks should be acknowledged somehow.|Jonathan Galassi|Think, Line, Like 
For me, poetry is a situation - a state of being, a way of facing life and facing history.|Tahar Ben Jelloun|Life, History, Me 
I came to poetry through the urgent need to denounce injustice, exploitation, humiliation. I know that's not enough to change the world. But to remain silent would have been a kind of intolerable complicity.|Tahar Ben Jelloun|Change, Change The World 
I love to read poetry but I haven't written anything that I'm willing to show anybody.|Abraham Verghese|Love, Anything, Show 
You will not find poetry anywhere unless you bring some of it with you.|Joseph Joubert|You, Find, Bring 
Publishing a volume of verse is like dropping a rose petal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo.|Don Marquis|Rose, Waiting, Down 
Poetry is what Milton saw when he went blind.|Don Marquis|Blind, Saw, He 
All voices are important, and yet it seems that people of color have a lot to say, particularly if you look through the poetry of young people - a lot of questions and a lot of concerns about immigration and security issues, you name it - big questions.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Color, People, Name 
I gave my voice to poetry.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Voice, Gave 
Poetry, as odd as it is, and as hard to figure out as it is, many times, it's almost something that we're used to. It's kind of like a dream language that we had centuries ago, so that when we speak poetically or write a poem about what's going on, a real difficult issue that's facing our communities, people listen.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Language, Speak, People 
San Diego shaped me a lot. The visual landscapes, the emotional panoramas, the teachers and mentors I had from the third grade through San Diego High - it's all a big part of the poetry fountain that I continue to drink from.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Me, Emotional, Mentors 
The banner of the project is 'Casa de Colores.' Under that banner, I'm going to invite people to do a lot of good things. Perhaps working in groups, working on poetry.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Good, People, Good Things 
My mother was a washerwoman - or a woman that cleaned houses in Texas... in Plano, Texas - who always loved poetry and always loved stories.|Juan Felipe Herrera|Mother, Woman, Loved 
I write all the time - I write poetry, I love to write.|Colin Quinn|Love, Time, Write 
I'm not a writer. I think I can write short stories and poetry, but film writing, brilliant film writing, is a talent - you can't just do it like that.|Samantha Morton|Writing, Short, Talent 
It's like I understand images and some people understand poetry.|Samantha Morton|People, Understand 
It's bad poetry executed by people that can't sing. That's my definition of Rap.|Peter Steele|People, Bad, Rap 
My favorite subject probably was math. I love math. Figures just intrigue me. I was really good at math. English probably was my worst subject. But I used to write a lot of poetry. I used to write poetry all the time.|Herschel Walker|Love, Time, Good 
Poetry is at the centre of my life, too, emotionally speaking, and intellectually speaking - it's just that I'm one of those people who enjoy doing other stuff as well.|Andrew Motion|Life, Enjoy, People 
I'm not precisely saying that a really good board meeting at the MLA (Museums, Libraries and Archives Coucil) makes me want to go and write poetry, but there is a pleasure in doing that sort of thing well.|Andrew Motion|Good, Me, Want 
I wish I'd been better able to resist the sense of obligation to write some of the poems I did. It's in the nature of commissioned work to be written too much from the side of your mind that knows what it's doing, which dries up the poetry.|Andrew Motion|Work, Nature, Mind 
In a general way, I want to be a kind of flag-waver, bunting hanger-up, drum-beater, you name it, for poetry.|Andrew Motion|Name, Want, You 
Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos.|Andrew Motion|Football, Thanks, Kind 
I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations; and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry.|Andrew Motion|Time, Great, Trying 
More people are reading poetry now than at any time in the history of the human race.|Andrew Motion|Time, History, Reading 
There is something about poetry beyond prose logic, there is mystery in it, not to be explained but admired.|Edward Young|Mystery, Logic, Something 
I got scouted for modeling on the street. I'm such a tomboy - still am. I just never thought about modeling before, but I thought, 'Ooh, interesting, similar world, perhaps it's a way into something.' Then, I was on my third photo shoot ever, and Adam Leech from 'Downtown Abbey' saw me reading poetry and asked me to recite some.|Anya Taylor-Joy|Reading, World, Me 
All through childhood, I wrote verses and mysteries. There is, for me, one connection: structure. My poetry is metrical, rhyming.|Sophie Hannah|Childhood, Me, Connection 
Those who have never entered upon scientific pursuits know not a tithe of the poetry by which they are surrounded.|Herbert Spencer|Know, Never, Which 
I always credited my mother with inspiring me to be a writer because she was such a passionate reader. She read poetry to me as a child. But rather late in life, I've come to appreciate my father, the accountant. He was a solid, organized, get-the-job-done kind of person-and you need that piece of it to be a writer, too.|Judith Viorst|Life, Father, Mother 
I thought it would be a funny concept to publish a book about stand-up comedy with Faber, the poetry publisher, and to apply to stand-up the same sort of weight of annotation that you would to a classic work of literature, an epic poem. I thought that would be funny.|Stewart Lee|Funny, Work, Book 
I accept all interpretations of my films. The only reality is before the camera. Each film I make is kind of a return to poetry for me, or at least an attempt to create a poem.|Bernardo Bertolucci|Reality, Me, Camera 
The poet is a specialist in something which everyone practises. Herein, poetry differs from the other arts. Everyone does not practise music or painting or even dancing, but everyone without exception puts together words poetically every day of his life.|Louis MacNeice|Life, Music, Together 
Everyone is not able, or inclined, to write poetry in the narrower sense any more than everyone is qualified to take part in a walking race. But just as all of us can and do walk, so all of us can and do use language poetically.|Louis MacNeice|Language, Walking, Walk 
The rules or 'laws' of poetry are only tentative devices, an approximate scheme. There is no Sinaitic recipe for poetry, for the individual poem is the norm.|Louis MacNeice|Rules, Individual, Laws 
The novel is born of disillusionment; the poem, of despair.|Jose Bergamin|Born, Despair 
Poetry is adolescence fermented, and thus preserved.|Jose Ortega y Gasset|Adolescence, Thus, Preserved 
Everything is complicated; if that were not so, life and poetry and everything else would be a bore.|Wallace Stevens|Life, Complicated 
To me, art begets art. Painting feeds the eye just as poetry feeds the ear, which is to say that both feed the soul.|Susan Vreeland|Art, Soul, Me 
If you put a real leaf and a silk leaf side by side, you'll see something of the difference between Homer's poetry and anyone else's. There seem to be real leaves still alive in the 'Iliad,' real animals, real people, real light attending everything.|Alice Oswald|Light, Leaf, People 
Poetry for me is as much a spiritual practice as sexual ecstasy is.|James Broughton|Spiritual, Me, Practice 
I sometimes talk about the making of a poem within the poem.|Howard Nemerov|Sometimes, Within, Talk 
Everyone thinks they're going to write one book of poems or one novel.|Marilyn Hacker|Book, Everyone, Going 
Poetry remembers that it was an oral art before it was a written art.|Jorge Luis Borges|Art, Before, Remembers 
I know nothing new except that Herr Gellert, the Leipzig poet, is dead, and has written no more poetry since his death.|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Death, Know, New 
There is one type of ideal woman very seldom described in poetry - the old maid, the woman whom sorrow or misfortune prevents from fulfilling her natural destiny.|Lafcadio Hearn|Woman, Destiny, Sorrow 
No poem is easily grasped so why should any reader expect fast results? |John Barton|Fast, Results, Why 
Sometimes poetry is inspired by the conversation entered into by reading other poems.|John Barton|Reading, Conversation 
An experienced reader uses the poem as an agent of inquiry. This makes poetry very exciting, unstable, and interactive.|John Barton|Inquiry, Poem, Interactive 
I studied poetry in college and for a year in an MFA program. As time went on, my poems got more and more complicated. What I was really trying to do was tell stories.|Jennifer McMahon|Time, College, Trying 
I like poems that are little games.|Peter Davison|Like, Games, Little 
I'm quite sure that most writers would sustain real poetry if they could, but it takes devotion and talent.|Marguerite Young|Talent, Real, Devotion 
I was always making up rhymes. But I never thought that poetry would become my life.|Saul Williams|Life, Thought, My Life 
Science and art, or by the same token, poetry and prose differ from one another like a journey and an excursion. The purpose of the journey is its goal, the purpose of an excursion is the process.|Franz Grillparzer|Art, Journey, Science 
I'll try anything, but the pig testicles in Taiwan were a little much. Eh, it wasn't half bad. There was this one dish I had there, the translation is, 'The Monk Jumps over the Fence.' It's a fish dish with all these spices. It was beautiful, man - it was poetry. It had a whole story.|Steven Adams|Beautiful, Man, Fish 
Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.|Horace Walpole|Art, Beautiful, Harmony 
I believe in the power of poetry, which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light.|Mahmoud Darwish|Light, Power, Believe 
I see poetry as spiritual medicine.|Mahmoud Darwish|Spiritual, Medicine, See 
Against barbarity, poetry can resist only by confirming its attachment to human fragility like a blade of grass growing on a wall while armies march by.|Mahmoud Darwish|Grass, Growing, Human 
That sense of a life in natural objects, which in most poetry is but a rhetorical artifice, was, then, in Wordsworth the assertion of what was for him almost literal fact.|Walter Pater|Life, Him, Natural 
Still, language is resilient, and poetry when it is pressured simply goes underground.|Diane Wakoski|Language, Resilient, Still 
I really love poetry. I'm a big E.E. Cummings fan and a big Walt Whitman fan, and I have a big book of poetry.|Mae Whitman|Love, Book, Big 
I didn't know how to weigh ideas about poetry. Nothing in the life I lived as a student - and later as wife and mother at the suburban edge of Dublin - suggested I had the wherewithal to do so. But I did have a unit of measurement. It was the measure of my own life.|Eavan Boland|Life, Mother, Wife 
Usually a life turned into a poem is misrepresented.|Mark Strand|Life, Poem, Turned 
Pain is filtered in a poem so that it becomes finally, in the end, pleasure.|Mark Strand|Pain, End, Pleasure 
You don't help people in your poems. I've been trying to help people all my life - that's my trouble.|Charles Olson|Life, People, Help 
There'll always be working people in my poems because I grew up with them, and I am a poet of memory.|Philip Levine|I Am, Memory, People 
I wonder if I ever thought of an ideal reader... I guess when I was in my 20s and in New York and maybe even in my early 30s, I would write for my wife Janice... mainly for my poet friends and my wife, who was very smart about poetry.|Kenneth Koch|Friends, Smart, Wife 
We all need ways to express ourselves, and poetry is one of mine.|Jack Prelutsky|Need, Mine, Express 
Poetry seems to sink into us the way prose doesn't. I can still quote verses I learned when I was very young, but I have trouble remembering one line of a novel I just finished reading.|Jack Prelutsky|Reading, I Can, Young 
Children seem naturally drawn to poetry - it's some combination of the rhyme, rhythm, and the words themselves.|Jack Prelutsky|Children, Words, Rhyme 
I started out as a writer. Poetry and prose and also kind of satirical David Sedaris-esque stuff.|Pauley Perrette|Kind, Writer, Started 
Eloquence is the poetry of prose.|William C. Bryant|Eloquence, Prose 
The first function of poetry is to tell the truth, to learn how to do that, to find out what you really feel and what you really think.|June Jordan|Truth, Think, You 
I wanted to write the kind of poetry that people read and remembered, that they lived by - the kinds of lines that I carried with me from moment to moment on a given day without even having chosen to.|Tracy K. Smith|Day, Moment, Me 
I come here to speak poetry. It will always be in the grass. It will also be necessary to bend down to hear it. It will always be too simple to be discussed in assemblies.|Boris Pasternak|Simple, Speak, Down 
That is to say, epic poetry has been invented many times and independently; but, as the needs which prompted the invention have been broadly similar, so the invention itself has been.|Lascelles Abercrombie|Epic, Say, Invention 
Do-gooders are easily overlooked. We're supposed to be soft, touchy-feely types, who wear Birkenstocks, compost everything, and write poetry by candlelight.|Nancy Lublin|Everything, Write 
The same people who are murdered slowly in the mechanized slaughterhouses of work are also arguing, singing, drinking, dancing, making love, holding the streets, picking up weapons and inventing a new poetry.|Raoul Vaneigem|Love, Work, People 
You don't have to suffer to be a poet adolescence is enough suffering for anyone. |John Ciardi|Suffering, You, Adolescence 
Poetry lies its way to the truth.|John Ciardi|Truth, Way, Lies 
I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose.|Shelby Foote|Writing, Interesting, Things 
Poetry is the mother-tongue of the human race.|Johann Georg Hamann|Race, Human, Human Race 
Even when poetry has a meaning, as it usually has, it may be inadvisable to draw it out... Perfect understanding will sometimes almost extinguish pleasure.|A. E. Housman|Understanding, Meaning 
If you read quickly to get through a poem to what it means, you have missed the body of the poem.|M. H. Abrams|Body, You, Through 
I think there are things in my story that have helped my creativity. Your father being killed, for instance, is one of the best things that could happen to a kid if he's going to write poetry or songs.|Roger Waters|Best, Creativity, Father 
We all write poems it is simply that poets are the ones who write in words. |John Fowles|Words, Write, Who 
Poetry is the deification of reality.|Edith Sitwell|Reality 
No, what I should really like to do right now, in the full blaze of lights, before this illustrious assembly, is to shower every one of you with gifts, with flowers, with offerings of poetry - to be young once more, to ride on the crest of the wave.|Knut Hamsun|Flowers, Ride, You 
Cut quarrels out of literature, and you will have very little history or drama or fiction or epic poetry left.|Robert Staughton Lynd|History, Literature, Drama 
I think that one possible definition of our modern culture is that it is one in which nine-tenths of our intellectuals can't read any poetry.|Randall Jarrell|Culture, Think, Modern 
To a poet the mere making of a poem can seem to solve the problem of truth, but only a problem of art is solved in poetry.|Laura Riding|Art, Truth, Problem 
The end of poetry is not to create a physical condition which shall give pleasure to the mind... The end of poetry is not an after-effect, not a pleasurable memory of itself, but an immediate, constant and even unpleasant insistence upon itself.|Laura Riding|Memory, Mind, End 
Well, I write a lot of poetry - that's where it usually all starts. I definitely want to show you guys sides of me - love, loss, heartbreak - all of that good stuff!|Tristan Wilds|Love, Good, Me 
Each memorable verse of a true poet has two or three times the written content.|Alfred de Musset|True, Memorable, Three 
However, if a poem can be reduced to a prose sentence, there can't be much to it.|James Schuyler|Poem, Sentence, Prose 
I used to joke that if acting didn't work out, poetry was my commonsense fallback.|Merritt Wever|Work, Acting, Joke 
I wrote poetry, journals, and, especially, plays for the neighborhood kids to perform. I had an ordinary, happy childhood. Nothing much was going on, but I had fun.|Alex Flinn|Happy, Childhood, Fun 
Society's dark hull drifts further and further away. It is this place - the place of our separation, our distinction - that much of his poetry occupies.|Tomas Transtromer|Society, Dark, Place 
I was kind of an outcast in school 'cause I always kept to myself and was writing poetry and then going on tour with my brother band all the time, so kids didn't know what to make of me.|Christina Perri|Time, Myself, School 
And inasmuch as the bridge is a symbol of all such poetry as I am interested in writing it is my present fancy that a year from now I'll be more contented working in an office than ever before.|Hart Crane|I Am, Writing, Bridge 
Painting (like poetry) chooses from universals what is most apposite. It brings together, in a single imaginary being, circumstances and characteristics which occur in nature in many different persons.|Francisco Goya|Nature, Together, Painting 
The job of the poet is to render the world - to see it and report it without loss, without perversion. No poet ever talks about feelings. Only sentimental people do.|Mark Van Doren|Job, Loss, World 
Reality only reveals itself when it is illuminated by a ray of poetry.|Georges Braque|Reality, Only, Itself 
How do poems grow? They grow out of your life.|Robert Penn Warren|Life, Grow, Your 
The poem is a little myth of man's capacity of making life meaningful. And in the end, the poem is not a thing we see-it is, rather, a light by which we may see-and what we see is life.|Robert Penn Warren|Life, Light, Man 
You don't make a poem with ideas, but with words.|Stephane Mallarme|Words, Ideas, You 
Freedom is poetry, taking liberties with words, breaking the rules of normal speech, violating common sense. Freedom is violence.|Norman O. Brown|Freedom, Words, Violence 
I intended an Ode, And it turned to a Sonnet.|Henry Austin Dobson|Turned, Ode, Intended 
A poem can have an impact, but you can't expect an audience to understand all the nuances.|Douglas Dunn|Impact, Understand, You 
I've always written poetry and lyrics. My first husband, who was a musician, we wrote a bunch of songs together.|P. J. Soles|Together, Husband, First 
There is the view that poetry should improve your life. I think people confuse it with the Salvation Army.|John Ashbery|Life, People, Think 
Don't call my lyrics poetry. It's an insult to real poets.|Bernie Taupin|Real, Insult, Call 
I don't look on poetry as closed works. I feel they're going on all the time in my head and I occasionally snip off a length.|John Ashbery|Time, Look, Head 
The mystic purchases a moment of exhilaration with a lifetime of confusion; and the confusion is infectious and destructive. It is confusing and destructive to try and explain anything in terms of anything else, poetry in terms of psychology.|Basil Bunting|Moment, Psychology, Try 
I've been surprised to learn how many people love poetry. It's beautiful to see that people want poetry in their lives.|Peleg Top|Love, Beautiful, People 
It's always good to show that poetry isn't the little depressed lyric people believe it to be, that it's something bigger.|John Fuller|Good, Believe, People 
In Bonn, where I studied for a year, I changed from classical to Romance philology, taught there by its great founder, F. Diez, and at the beginning of 1852, I received the doctorate for a dissertation on the refrain in Provencal poetry.|Paul Heyse|Great, Beginning, Year 
Poetry is an orphan of silence. The words never quite equal the experience behind them.|Charles Simic|Experience, Silence, Words

It's a joke to think that anyone is one thing. We're all such complex creatures. But if I'm going to be a poster child for anything, anger's a gorgeous emotion. It gets a bad rap, but it can make great changes happen.|Alanis Morissette|Great, Changes, Child

As the lady who thought they wrote better than William Shakespeare. As the lady who thought every picture they drew was a Rembrandt.|Judith Viorst|Love, Children, Mother 
But one of the hardest things for me to do was to access anger. I could do it on stage. But when I did it on film it was hard for me. That probably has to do with the intimacy of film.

Green Arrow has gone through so many changes; he's been right-wing, he's been left-wing, he's been rich, he's been poor, he's been a social justice guy, then when I got him, he was a rich playboy guy.

Being told about the effects of climate change is an appeal to our reason and to our desire to bring about change.

I literally used to stare at my face in the mirror with hate and anger.

Children used to get bullied at school. Now they go home, and that's where the problem starts - because they sit on their phones all night, thinking about who's 'liked' a photo of them, who hates them, who loves them.

The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.

Whether at work, at home or in public, we have been trained to believe that who we are at the core of our being is often unacceptable.

I'm one of the most adaptable guys I know in as much as travelling is my favourite thing to do in life.

Once I imagine that, then it's OK for me to return home.|Matthew McConaughey|Life, Justice, Me

What I've learned in my life, it's a very interesting social study for me, to go back and forth between being the guy at home and being the guy on the road and being the guy in studio and being the guy in the interview. The environment around you has so much to do with your character, and when I'm home, my character really changes quite a bit.|John Mayer|Life, Character, Changes 
I'm a firm believer that lighting affects mood, and twinkly lights on strings bring something magical to occasions ranging from concerts to weddings, though I'm fond of using them as year-round home decor.

If your neighbors think you're a detective because a cop always brings you home, you might be a redneck.|Jeff Foxworthy|Think, You, Neighbors 
An oligarchy of race, where the Saxon rules the African, might be endured; but this oligarchy of sex which makes father, brothers, husband, sons, the oligarchs over the mother and sisters, the wife and daughters of every household... carries discord and rebellion into every home of the nation.|Susan B. Anthony|Father, Mother, Wife 
I hate leaving home. I love what I do, but I'd love to go home every night.|Charlie Watts|Love, Hate, Night

I have no idea how to get in touch with anyone anymore. Everyone, it seems, has a home phone, a cell phone, a regular e-mail account, a Facebook account, a Twitter account, and a Web site.

The coolest thing, and I have it at home, is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours. When you hit the bumpers and the bells ring it goes, 'Oh yeah!' The whole time you're playing this machine it's yelling and screaming at you, 'What you gonna do, brother?!' I think that's the coolest.|Hulk Hogan|Time, Brother, People 
Often I have heard the taunt that suffragists are women who have failed to find any normal outlet for their emotions, and are therefore soured and disappointed beings.

The aesthetic came along the way, I think - just through experimenting, and going on tour, and trying stuff out on stage, having fun with it, and not taking it too seriously.

That's where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up.|Florence Welch|Having Fun, Fun, Charity 
I'm the type who'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I wasn't going to. I'm the type who'd like to sit home and watch every party that I'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom.|Andy Warhol|Happy, Be Happy, Long

I knew something was wrong, but I had no idea what.|Michael Crawford|Life, Challenge, Man 
Many women assume they can't be good mothers and have challenging careers at the same time, so they might give up trying to do both as they get to a crucial point in their career.

You don't see me in Los Angeles a lot. I go back home. Because I can't play the game. I can't - my tolerance - I know I'm getting old I'll be 50 this year. And you know how I know I'm getting old? 'Cause my tolerance level is low. |Bernie Mac|Game, Me, Know

Ladies love a soppy lyric. There's a real winner in 'Carry You Home.'|James Blunt|Love, Winner, You 
I'd never put all my chips anywhere, because I don't want to close any doors, but I was raised in a very blue-collar family. I was raised by parents who said, 'If you don't go to work every day, you're not contributing', so that's my mentality. I have to work every day; I have to bring home a paycheck.|Katee Sackhoff|Work, Family, Parents 
You have to be very insensitive in order to have a cat, because I think they're very independent.

'Feminist comedy,' practically an oxymoron, had a couple of good years after WWII.

When I was eight, I would look at the cover of the 'Ghost Rider' comic book in my little home in Long Beach, California, and I couldn't get my head around how something that scary could also be good.

There's only one thing harder than living in a home with an adolescent - and that's being an adolescent.

I have been given a list of 35 white farmers in Mashonaland West alone. We say no to whites owning our land, and they should go... They can own companies and apartments... but not the soil.

You alone are enough.|Oprah Winfrey|You, Enough

The first thought that I had about really trying to get sober was, 'Man, I could do a lot of good in the world. I can lead by example and just be this heroic recovery guy.'

The thing about markets, and I think the thing people don't understand about that, is markets are not kind, but they're very efficient.

When I'm writing, I separate from everyone. Even my band. I push myself, and I'm alone with my thoughts.

People eat duck and you think, well, we've got loads of chickens, leave the ducks alone!|Karl Pilkington|People, Think, You 
Solitude is very different from a 'time-out' from our busy lives. Solitude is the very ground from which community grows.

Writing music and lyrics, you tend to become a control freak - sitting alone in your room with a bare light bulb over your head, writing communist manifestos.|Jason Robert Brown|Music, Light, Writing

It is not necessary that you leave the house. Remain at your table and listen. Do not even listen, only wait. Do not even wait, be wholly still and alone.

I like the idea of being a sculptor. Just me alone, making something - that solitary existence.|Ewan McGregor|Me, Idea, Existence

They were fantasy books about ghosts, and also books by Edgar Allen Poe that made a forever impression on me.|Dario Argento|Father, Me, Remember

I spend most of my time in a room alone where eight hours go by, and I have no sense of time. I work seven days a week, and I live in this sort of vague subconscious fog a lot.|Dan Gilroy|Work, Time, Week 
If a gigantic asteroid were barreling toward impact with our planet, you can bet there would be at least a few members of Congress who would insist on leaving it alone, either because they would see it as a warning shot from the Almighty or because a mining company with a savvy team of lobbyists had laid claim to the big rock.|David Horsey|Team, Leaving, Company

I actually like spending time alone - it doesn't bother me at all.|Jacob Whitesides|Time, Me, Spending Time

Absolutely lonely people have few personal interactions of any kind.|Martha Beck|People, Lonely, Personal

When 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' premiered on the WB Network in 1996, American culture was in trouble.

When I realized I was depressed, then I started reading up about it. When I read that one in four people are depressed, I felt that I'm not the only one.

Most photographers work best alone, myself included.|Elliott Erwitt|Work, Best, Myself 
Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque.

And I know I can't just live in my head.|Tony Parsons|World, End, Live

If our system continues without modification involving environmental and social concern, we will face an economic and social breakdown of our outdated monetary and political system.|Jacque Fresco|Political, Face, Economic

The Safe Drinking Water Act, the safety provisions of the Clean Water Acts, the Clean Air Act, the Superfund Law - the gas industry is exempt from all these basic environmental and worker protections.

I think the cost of energy will come down when we make this transition to renewable energy.|Al Gore|Energy, Transition, Think

We may achieve climate, but weather is thrust upon us.|O. Henry|Weather, Achieve, May

All too often, the conversation about appropriate and balanced environmental stewardship gets caught up in partisan politics. Yet, this conversation is key to the preservation of our great country for generations to come, as important as ensuring we have fiscally responsible policies to secure our future.|Chris Gibson|Future, Great, Politics 
I think the environmental problem will be the number one item on the agenda of the 21st century... This is a problem that cannot be postponed.|Mikhail Gorbachev|Problem, Think, 21st Century 
The main environmental challenge of the 21st century is poverty. When you don't know where your next meal is coming from, it's hard to consider the environment 100 years down the line.|Bjorn Lomborg|Challenge, Poverty 
The BP spill was the greatest environmental catastrophe in U.S. history. Yet somehow, gas companies like BP and Halliburton ran interference on reporting that story.|Josh Fox|History, Greatest, Story 
And I know that the younger generation is doing things that are so ingenious. And for them it's not a matter of a political belief or an environmental stance. It's really just common sense.|Daryl Hannah|Generation, Political 
All living beings, not just animals, but plants and microorganisms, perceive. To survive, an organic being must perceive - it must seek, or at least recognize, food and avoid environmental danger.|Lynn Margulis|Food, Plants, Animals 
I align myself with almost all researchers in assuming that anything we do is a composite of whatever genetic limitations were given to us by our parents and whatever kinds of environmental opportunities are available.|Howard Gardner|Myself, Parents 
Business has a way of talking about how to create value, which is in some way isn't bad... We just need to start thinking about if the value we want to create is consistent with all social and environmental well being.|Peter Senge|Business, Value, Thinking 
I hope that in future Congresses there will reemerge a recognition that climate change is a reality, that our policies to meet our energy needs must also deal responsibly with environmental issues, including the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions.|Jeff Bingaman|Change, Hope, Future 
What we know is that the environmental movement had a series of dazzling victories in the late '60s and in the '70s where the whole legal framework for responding to pollution and to protecting wildlife came into law. It was just victory after victory after victory. And these were what came to be called 'command-and-control' pieces of legislation.|Naomi Klein|Law, Legal, Victory 
As President Trump quickly moved to limit immigration, civil rights, and environmental protections, I felt fear for my young children, and guilt, too - as if I'd somehow betrayed the unspoken contract all parents make to give our children a better life than ourselves.|Laura Moser|Life, Children, Fear 
Congressional Republicans are dismantling the limited environmental protections initiated by Richard Nixon, who would be something of a dangerous radical in today's political scene.|Noam Chomsky|Today, Political, Dangerous 
There are plenty of problems in the world, and doubtless climate change - or whatever the currently voguish phrase for it all is - certainly is one of them. But it's low on my list.|P. J. O'Rourke|Change, Problems, World 
I think it makes people in the Pentagon kind of nervous to know that chemical agents and environmental factors could cause so much damage in terms of what may happen in the future.|Bernie Sanders|Future, People, Know 
I see a future where states compete with one another to see which can be the most efficient, and where businesses seek out efficient states in which to locate so they can reap the economic and environmental benefits for their businesses and employees.|Bernie Sanders|Future, Employees, See 
It took a generation for companies to recognise their responsibilities in terms of labour practices and another generation for them to recognise their environmental obligations.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Generation, Obligations 
Over the past several decades, a growing number of investors have been choosing to put their money in funds that screen companies for their environmental and labor records. Some socially responsible investors are starting to add free expression and privacy to their list of criteria.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Money, Past, Free 
Without global human rights, labor and environmental movements, companies would still be hiring 12-year-olds as a matter of course and poisoning our groundwater without batting an eyelid.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Matter, Rights, Human 
I'd been making music that was intended to be like painting, in the sense that it's environmental, without the customary narrative and episodic quality that music normally has. I called this 'ambient music.' But at the same time I was trying to make visual art become more like music, in that it changed the way that music changes.|Brian Eno|Music, Time, Art 
This is absolutely bizarre that we continue to subsidize highways beyond the gasoline tax, airlines, and we don't subsidize, we don't want to subsidize a national rail system that has environmental impact.|Joe Biden|Impact, Tax, Want 
The Moon stabilizes Earth's obliquity. Well, almost. The tilt actually varies between 22 and 24.5 degrees - and the variation is enough to induce such environmental inconveniences as the occasional ice age. Without the Moon, it might be much worse.|Seth Shostak|Age, Moon, Earth 
We live in a world bathed in 5,000 times more energy than we consume as a species in the year, in the form of solar energy. It's just not in usable form yet.|Peter Diamandis|World, Energy, Live 
I have voted against only one of President Obama's nominees: Michael Froman, a Citigroup alumnus who is currently storming the halls of Congress as U.S. Trade Representative pushing trade deals that threaten to undermine financial regulation, workers' rights, and environmental protections.|Elizabeth Warren|Financial, President, Rights 
The environment has fallen to the wayside in politics.|Craig Venter|Politics, Environment 
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.|Craig Venter|Food, Future, Think 
You always bump into politics in life, and as a man, I'm party to a number of environmental issues that concern me first and foremost, as a man, as a father.|Pierce Brosnan|Life, Father, Politics 
I always thought we had an environmental problem, but I hadn't realized how urgent it was. James Lovelock writes that by the end of this century there will be one billion people left.|Vivienne Westwood|End, People, Problem 
Economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life. The result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scot-free and ignores the environmental cost.|Vivienne Westwood|Life, Science, Treat 
It's worth knowing more about the complicated environmental and genetic factors that could explain why traumatic brain injuries lead to long-term disabilities in some people and not in others.|Anne Wojcicki|Brain, People, Why

The environmental movement doesn't have many deserters and has a high level of recruitment. Eventually, there will be open war.|Paul Watson|War, Movement, High 
Usually, environmental programs are not designed for a mainstream audience.|Paul Watson|Audience, Mainstream 
I've won some awards. 'Time' magazine designated me as one of the environmental heroes of the 20th century. Oh, and I've got some honorary citizenships, like from the Conch Republic of the Florida Keys. But the one thing I am proud of is I didn't get the Chevron environmental award. Never did get that one.|Paul Watson|Time, I Am, Me 
I've used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible. And secondly, I've still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth.|Jimmy Carter|Freedom, Peace, Quality 
We now see numerous examples of brands working together to address issues such as environmental degradations, climate control, pollution, poverty and disease.|Simon Mainwaring|Working Together, Together 
When people align around shared political, social, economic or environmental values, and take collective action, thinking and behavior that compromises the lives of millions of people around the world can truly change.|Simon Mainwaring|Change, Thinking, World 
I've always been interested in the industrialization of our food it's been an issue for me from an environmental and animal rights and human health perspective. |Richard Linklater|Food, Health, Animal 
In the environmental movement, every time you lose a battle it's for good, but our victories always seem to be temporary and we keep fighting them over and over again.|David Suzuki|Time, Good, Battle 
It's not unexpected that shooting massive amounts of water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure into the earth to shatter shale and release natural gas might shake things up. But earthquakes aren't the worst problem with fracking.|David Suzuki|Water, Problem, Pressure 
Beyond reducing individual use, one of our top priorities must be to move from fossil fuels to energy that has fewer detrimental effects on water supplies and fewer environmental impacts overall.|David Suzuki|Water, Priorities, Energy 
I always felt that if someone shot me, it would be great for the environmental movement, because they would make me a martyr. Our biggest fear was our children, because there was a tremendous amount of threat and intimidation, and my wife was terrified that the children might be grabbed or assaulted in some way. That was the real fear.|David Suzuki|Children, Fear, Great 
Liberals in Congress have spent the past three decades pandering to environmental extremists. The policies they have put in place are in large part responsible for the energy crunch we are seeing today. We have not built a refinery in this country for 30 years.|Marsha Blackburn|Today, Past, Energy 
It should be noted that the EPA's banning of methanol is categorically absurd from the point of view of environmental protection.|Robert Zubrin|View, Point Of View 
From 1859 to 1971, the U.S. oil industry grew virtually continuously, in the process serving mightily to drive our economy and win our wars. But that growth was stopped dead in 1971 and sent into decline thereafter, as the advent of the EPA and the accompanying National Environmental Policy Act made it increasingly difficult to drill.|Robert Zubrin|Growth, Win, Oil 
There's every reason to think that whatever their political leanings, Americans will be highly receptive to numerous reforms designed to improve health, safety, economic security, environmental quality and democratic self-government - at least if those reforms do not eliminate their freedom of choice.|Cass Sunstein|Freedom, Health, Safety 
Just as there's garbage that pollutes the Potomac river, there is garbage polluting our culture. We need an Environmental Protection Agency to clean it up.|Pat Buchanan|Culture, River, Garbage 
I feel privileged to be a U.N. ambassador. It gives me an opportunity to use my voice to help raise awareness about important social and environmental issues.|Gisele Bundchen|Opportunity, Me, Help 
Nature's patterns sometimes reflect two intertwined features: fundamental physical laws and environmental influences. It's nature's version of nature versus nurture.|Brian Greene|Nature, Nurture, Laws 
When you buy a jacket, you pick the size to ensure it fits. Similarly, we live in a universe in which the amount of dark energy fits our biological make-up. If the amount of dark energy were substantially different from what we've measured, the environmental conditions would be inhospitable to our form of life.|Brian Greene|Life, Universe, Dark 
That's the big mistake the environmental movement made - 'We'll scare the hell out of you, and you'll become an activist'.|Naomi Klein|Mistake, Hell, You 
All we can hope for is that the thing is going to slowly and imperceptibly shift. All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.|David Attenborough|Hope, I Can, Say 
I have been a long-term environmental advocate for the agriculture industry. I have particularly tried to push carbon farming or carbon sequestration.|Sam Brownback|Agriculture, Push, Farming

I'm not afraid to spend money on the R&D that's really going to move us to a cleaner energy source that I think is so much the answer to the issues of environmental responsibility and climate change.|Lisa Murkowski|Change, Money 
If you look at the history of other movements, whether Civil Rights or environmental rights, these are all decades-long undertakings.|Mitch Kapor|History, Look, You 
I've always thought the main argument for organic was more environmental than a health argument. I just don't think spraying a lot of pesticides into the environment on a routine basis is a good thing.|John Mackey|Good, Health, Thought 
The NFL, sadly, has a fatal environmental problem: It kills its workers.|Matt Taibbi|Problem, NFL, Workers 
Many environmental battles are won by delaying a destructive project long enough to change the conversation - to allow new economic, political and social dynamics to emerge.|Frances Beinecke|Change, Political 
I have long understood that climate change is not only an environmental issue - it is a humanitarian, economic, health, and justice issue as well.|Frances Beinecke|Change, Health, Justice 
When the government undertakes or approves a major project such as a dam or highway project, it must make sure the project's impacts, environmental and otherwise, are considered. In many cases, NEPA gives the public its only opportunity to be heard about the project's impact on their community.|Frances Beinecke|Community, Government 
What is the future going to say about us now? What are our kids going to look at us and say, 'How could you not stop that person from getting into power? How could you not stop that environmental disaster that you saw coming a mile away?'|Leslie Odom, Jr.|Future, Power, You 
The human and environmental devastation caused by nuclear weapons - whether by testing, mistake or malice - is the very reason we need to eliminate them altogether.|Valerie Plame|Mistake, Human, Reason 
Sustainability goes across everything I do with Adidas and everything I do with my own house, so the Olympic kit is no exception. It is incredibly environmental in the way that it is manufactured. For example, there's no leather; it's free from PVC. There's lots of woven materials, which means a lot less waste.|Stella McCartney|Free, Sustainability, House 
I hope my work contributes to understanding long-term patterns of human behavior and how we survive, thrive, or fail during times of environmental, social, and economic crisis.|Sarah Parcak|Work, Hope, Behavior 
I feel it is urgently necessary to train people who are capable of tackling the various problems we face today in regards to environmental turmoil and the relevancy of clothing.|Issey Miyake|Today, Problems, People 
I have younger friends who are in this pinch where they feel they've been counted out before they've had a chance to prove themselves. They've inherited a lot of debt - not just student debt but environmental debt, political debt. They really feel squeezed.|G. Willow Wilson|Friends, Political, Chance 
It's absolutely shameful that Rep. Grijalva would try to use tribes as political pawns to implement the misguided agenda of extremist environmental groups.|Paul Gosar|Political, Try, Tribes 
I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth, environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.|Al Gore|Growth, Moving Forward 
I believe we should reframe our response to climate change as an imperative for growth rather than merely being a way of being green or meeting environmental commitments.|William Hague|Change, Growth, Believe 
The worst environmental decision you can make as a human being is to have 14 kids.|Jane Velez-Mitchell|Decision, You, Human 
Wouldn't it help Americans more, in the long run, if we were forced to accept some responsibility for the environmental wreckage we prefer to assume is totally out of our control?|Jane Velez-Mitchell|Responsibility, Help 
On the environment and climate change, I suspect that future generations will think there was too much timidity, too much fear of upsetting business. Basically, New Labour was very nervous about regulating business, or requiring it to do anything, even when there was a very clear social or environmental case for doing so.|Geoff Mulgan|Change, Business, Fear 
We know that childhood and adolescence are the most crucial times for environmental stimuli to affect breast cancer risk, but changes made during adulthood and even after diagnosis still have the potential to create positive changes in the body.|Joel Fuhrman|Positive, Changes, Childhood 
I think there's a green side to John Kerry, if you like, that he's an environmental activist. His record on the environment is as best as you have on a pro-environment record of anybody in the U.S. Senate.|Douglas Brinkley|Best, Green, Environment 
Environmental spending creates jobs in engineering, manufacturing, construction, materials, operations and maintenance.|Keith Ellison|Construction, Engineering 
Our land-healing ministry really is about cultivating relationships: between the people, the loving stewards, and the ecology of a place, what I call the environmental umbilical that we're nurturing here.|Joel Salatin|People, Loving 
It really disturbs me that the environmental movement has been co-opted by creation-worshippers instead of being encouraged by the Creator-worshippers.|Joel Salatin|Me, Movement, Being 
Americans don't pay much attention to environmental issues, because they aren't sexy. I mean, cleaning up coal plants and reining in outlaw frackers is hugely important work, but it doesn't get anybody's pulse racing.|Jeff Goodell|Work, Sexy, Plants 
Mark Ruffalo, aka the Incredible Hulk, is the natural gas industry's worst nightmare: a serious, committed activist who is determined to use his star power as a superhero in the hottest movie of the moment to draw attention the environmental and public health risks of fracking.|Jeff Goodell|Health, Power, Moment 
Have we failed to slow global warming pollution in part because climate and environmental activists have been too polite and well behaved?|Jeff Goodell|Global Warming, Slow 
It is a world of extremes, which can be characterised most clearly in terms of exclusion. That means political exclusion, whereby the rights of citizens are marginalised by the interests of big business: George W Bush's environmental policy, for example, is clearly formulated in the interests of U.S. energy companies.|Noreena Hertz|Business, World, Political 
As fears about the energy and environmental crises reach a fever pitch, we're all searching for solutions. And one possibility is that we could fix everything if we'd just shrink our population back down to about 2 billion people - which would put us roughly where we were at 80 years ago.|Annalee Newitz|Energy, People, Reach 
The Keystone pipeline is one of those things that's sort of a political driver. And mostly, the Republicans use it to sort of embarrass the president and embarrass quite a few Democrats who feel that there's a potential for an environmental disaster.|Rodney Frelinghuysen|Political, Potential 
There's a myth out there that you have to genuflect at the altar of quarterly earnings. But it's a false choice that you can either be a good fiduciary or promote values such as environmental sustainability.|Thomas Perez|Good, Choice, Sustainability 
We have a project with Unocal here in Los Angeles, where we as an environmental organization, the oil company, and the state all get together to promote the recycling of used motor oil.|Ted Danson|Together, Company 
The environmental movement, like all political processes, reacts best to disasters. But these are very slow, very gradual disasters in the making.|Ted Danson|Best, Political, Slow 
Address these environmental issues and you will address every issue known to man. And we keep dabbling in things that aren't really that important in the long term.|Ted Danson|Man, Long, You 
We must not risk defunding environmental conservation programs, which is why Congress should reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund to preserve our natural resources.|Suzan DelBene|Water, Risk, Why 
As I have said all along, for any trade promotion authority bill to gain my support, it must require strong, enforceable environmental and labor protections.|Suzan DelBene|Strong, Support, Authority

I think Captain Cousteau might be the father of the environmental movement.|Ted Turner|Father, Captain, Think 
Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource, and human beings are not mere numbers. To suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science, environmental management, government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic.|James Buchan|Nature, Science, Government 
People who run environmental groups and things like that, who have to listen to all kinds of nonsense and keep their tempers, are very diplomatic and very inclusive.|Sigourney Weaver|People, Listen, Run 
Ever since we achieved a breakthrough in the area of recombinant DNA in 1973, left-wing nuts and environmental kooks have been screaming that we will create some kind of Frankenstein bug or Andromeda Strain that will destroy us all.|James D. Watson|DNA, Kind, Create 
I've had filmmakers, I even had Bono come and talk to me about having a sequel to 'E.T.' help with an environmental message - I listened. I can certainly understand. I mean, the great thing about Bono is that everything he does is in service to a greater cause.|Kathleen Kennedy|Great, Service, Help 
Computer programmers, biotechnologists, environmental scientists, neuroscientists, nanotech engineers - all of these fields, and more, should have at least a course in ethics as part of their degree requirements.|Jamais Cascio|Ethics, Engineers, Computer 
We are now heading down a centuries-long path toward increasing the productivity of our natural capital - the resource systems upon which we depend to live - instead of our human capital.|Paul Hawken|Path, Live, Productivity 
I think an old style of addressing environmental problems is ebbing, but the rise of the so-called conservative, political movement in this country is not a trend towards the future but a reaction to this very broad shift that we are undergoing.|Paul Hawken|Future, Style, Problems 
For too much of history, we've viewed the world's precious resources - both environmental and human - as things to extract, to make the most of in order to maximize their potential.|Jacqueline Novogratz|History, World, Potential 
I call upon governments to start supporting companies to use more sustainable materials in their products instead of continuing with antiquated incentives, such as import duties on synthetic materials that are in principle much higher compared with those placed on leather goods regardless of the environmental footprint.|Jochen Zeitz|Start, Leather, Products 
Let's recreate the equivalent of the Met Ball in Europe and, rather than for the museum, give the money to environmental causes.|Jochen Zeitz|Money, Museum, Give 
There is the GIS world that is largely managing authoritative data sources, supporting geocentric workflows like fixing roads, making cities more livable through better planning, environmental management, forest management, drilling in the right location for oil, managing assets and utilities.|Jack Dangermond|Planning, Management, World 
On almost every environmental issue I care about, in fact, I've been wrong at one point or another. I used to think that climate change was no big deal, that most environmental problems were massive exaggerations, that oil reserves were effectively unlimited, and more.|Ramez Naam|Change, Problems, Think 
Environmental concern is a phenomena that tends to rise in a nation after a certain level of wealth.|Ramez Naam|Wealth, Rise, Nation

There's a value in used electronic equipment, and currently, there are small, domestic recyclers that process this equipment safely. But they have a hard time competing with facilities overseas that have few, if any, environmental and safety standards.|Gene Green|Time, Safety, Value 
The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), which controls the living environment on shuttles and on the International Space Station, doesn't have the luxury of disposal: discharging trash into space has long been judged a bad idea.|Rose George|Life, Support, Space 
The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was. Who cared? But making ecological concerns matter to a company's bottom line will help it do the research and development that will reinvent everything we buy.|Daniel Goleman|Time, Today, Research 
Smog is affecting larger parts of China, and environmental pollution has become a major problem, which is nature's red-light warning against the model of inefficient and blind development.|Li Keqiang|Nature, Blind, Problem 
It is the public that is illiterate in science and math, a lazy press, and environmental advocacy groups that manufacture fear for misconceptions about energy.|Rex Tillerson|Fear, Science, Energy 
Brands who come to China, often they just care about price - so they actually drive the suppliers to cut corners on environmental standards to win a contract.|Ma Jun|Win, Care, Drive 
The motivation should come from regulatory enforcement, but enforcement is weak, and environmental litigation is near to impossible. So there's an urgent need for extensive public participation to generate another kind of motivation.|Ma Jun|Motivation, Impossible 
China has leapfrogged into this information age, and Web users have grown very significantly, which knocked down the cost of doing the environmental transparency.|Ma Jun|Age, Information, Doing 
In America, you complain about job losses because of China, but here, we carry all of the environmental costs.|Ma Jun|America, Job, You 
Environmental problems cannot be resolved here the way they are resolved in other countries. I heard that 80 per cent of the environmental problems in the U.S. are solved in court. That can't happen here.|Ma Jun|Problems, Way, Here 
On April 16, 2010, 34 Chinese environmental organizations, including Friends of Nature, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, and Green Beagle, questioned heavy metal pollution in a letter sent to CEO Steve Jobs.|Ma Jun|Nature, Friends, Green 
If major companies sourcing in developing countries care only about price and quality, local suppliers will be lured to cut corners on environmental standards to win contracts.|Ma Jun|Quality, Win, Care 
China leads the world in energy consumption, carbon emissions, and the release of major air and water pollutants, and the environmental impact is felt both regionally and globally.|Ma Jun|Water, Impact, World 
It has been shown that public participation can limit powerful interest groups, while competing interests can help find a reasonable balance between development and environmental protection.|Ma Jun|Powerful, Balance, Help 
China's environmental conundrums will not be solved by changes within government alone. New mechanisms are needed to allow the communities which may be affected by a given plan, and citizens concerned about the environment, to join in.|Ma Jun|Alone, Changes, Government 
Environmental agencies in China are hamstrung by local officials who put economic growth ahead of environmental protection; even the courts are beholden to local officials, and they are not open to environmental litigation.|Ma Jun|Growth, Ahead, Economic

China is bearing the environmental cost for much of the world because China is the factory of the world.|Ma Jun|World, Cost, Factory 
Urban residents, most of them middle class, have a much better sense of their environmental rights, and they're willing to take to the streets.|Ma Jun|Better, Class, Rights

For the U.S., I think we should have a carbon tax, for environmental reasons.|Tyler Cowen|Tax, Think, Carbon 
The way to make the world a better place, through your eating, is simply to eat a bit less meat. Local is sometimes good, sometimes bad. But even when it's good, its environmental impact is relatively small compared to other possible improvements.|Tyler Cowen|Good, World, Small 
A knowledgeable and courageous U.S. president could help enormously in leading the world's nations toward saving the climate.|Donella Meadows|World, Help, Courageous 
Like the other great revolutions, an environmental revolution will require sacrifices and lead to enormous gains.

Truly, we do live on a 'water planet.' For us, water is that critical issue that we need. It's the most precious substance on the planet, and it links us to pretty much every environmental issue, including climate change, that we're facing.|Philippe Cousteau, Jr.|Change, Water, Live 
I believe very strongly that corporations could and should be a major force for resolving social and environmental concerns in the twenty-first century.|William Clay Ford, Jr.|Believe, I Believe, Social 
There's a rising tide of environmental awareness and activism among consumers that's going to continue to swell in the 21st century. Smart companies will get ahead of that wave and ride it to success and prosperity. Those that don't are headed for a wipeout.|William Clay Ford, Jr.|Success, Smart, Ride 
Climate change is not a discrete issue; it's a symptom of larger problems. Fundamentally, our society as currently designed has no future. We're chewing up the planet so fast, in so many different ways, that we could solve the climate problem tomorrow and still find that environmental collapse is imminent.|Alex Steffen|Change, Future, Society 
Fracking has been used for more than 60 years to successfully drill over a million oil and gas wells in the U.S. Nonetheless, the prevailing mythology on the radical left is that the technology is 'poisoning our children' by polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.|Bob Beauprez|Technology, Children, Water 
China will soon emit more greenhouse gases than America, but its regime knows if it caps aspirations there will be a revolution.|James Lovelock|America, Revolution

I have heard over and over again that the drilling business is a dangerous business, and death is an expected part of the game, but I've also heard of the way that safety violations, human and environmental laws, and a concern for the local culture are flaunted in pursuit of money.|Alexandra Fuller|Business, Death, Money 
What is basically just an IQ score has roots in education, socioeconomic status, genetics, and environmental factors. Looking at any one of these roots doesn't give you a full picture of the tree, but it does tell you that a tree is there.|Kyle Hill|Education, Tree, Roots 
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - what a joke. In my district, we caught them lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale.

I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organizations can't be bothered to man the front lines of environmental protest.|Jello Biafra|Man, Wind, Me

Environmental pollution, terrorism, and many other global threats do not stop at borders. We all bear global responsibility and thus need a global identity to enable us to cope with them.

To avoid congestion, I get up at 5:10, grab a slice of raisin toast, and leave the house at 6 A.M. My husband, Tim Dunn, who works for an environmental agency, is still asleep when I slip out, and I find that rather annoying.|Ellen Stofan|Husband, Find, House 
And secondly, I would impose a significant state landfill tipping fee and use that tipping fee to fund the billion dollar bond issue that I want to create to produce the funds for all of the environmental challenges that we just went over.|Ed Rendell|Challenges, Want, Bond 
The whole environmental policy in the Netherlands has no substance any more.|Pim Fortuyn|Policy, Substance, Whole 
We have no reason to think that climate change is harmful if you look at the world as a whole. Most places, in fact, are better off being warmer than being colder. And historically, the really bad times for the environment and for people have been the cold periods rather than the warm periods.|Freeman Dyson|Change, World, People 
For me, adventures are a vehicle for travelling deep into the fabric of society, coming to know the environmental conditions that shape people's lives and viewing the present in the context of history.|Tim Cope|History, Deep, Society 
GM has never been about feeding the world or tackling environmental problems. It is and has always been about control of the global food economy by a tiny handful of giant corporations. It's not wicked to question that process. It is wicked not to.|Zac Goldsmith|Food, Problems, World 
We always hear from newspapers that while people understand the environmental challenge, they are unwilling to stomach the solutions. The trouble is, we only ever hear about the solutions from the media, and for whatever reason, they are almost always caricatured beyond recognition. If there's no appetite for green, it's not surprising.|Zac Goldsmith|Challenge, Media, Green 
By uploading 40 years of 'Ecologist' editions online, we will be creating the world's most extensive ecological archive. 'The Ecologist' will continue to set the environmental and political agenda here and abroad.|Zac Goldsmith|World, Political, Creating 
Politics colours everything, and anyone who wants change is necessarily political. As an environmental campaigner more or less since I left school in the early '90s, I have always been involved in lobbying, campaigning and pushing for changes.|Zac Goldsmith|Change, School, Politics 
'Green' is likely to be a big issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election - largely in response to George Bush's suicidal refusal to engage with environmental issues.|Zac Goldsmith|Election, Green, Response 
New Zealand needs to balance its environmental responsibilities with its economic opportunities, because the risk is that if you don't do that - and you want to lead the world - then you might end up getting unintended consequences.|John Key|Balance, World 
What we mean by an outcome will naturally depend on the context. Thus, for a government charged with delivering public goods, an outcome will consist of the quantities provided of such goods as intercity highways, national defense and security, environmental protection, and public education together with the arrangements by which they are financed.|Eric Maskin|Education, Government 
Earth Day 1970 was irrefutable evidence that the American people understood the environmental threat and wanted action to resolve it.|Barry Commoner|Day, American, Action 
The wave of new productive enterprises would provide opportunities to remedy the unjust distribution of environmental hazards among economic classes and racial and ethnic communities.|Barry Commoner|Opportunities, New, Economic 
The environmental crisis arises from a fundamental fault: our systems of production - in industry, agriculture, energy and transportation - essential as they are, make people sick and die.|Barry Commoner|Energy, People, Crisis 
By adopting the control strategy, the nation's environmental program has created a built-in antagonism between environmental quality and economic growth.|Barry Commoner|Growth, Quality, Strategy 
What I have experienced over time is that environmental problems are easier to deal with in ways that don't go into their interconnections to the rest of what we are.|Barry Commoner|Time, Problems, Rest 
I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise the trends and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges very powerful. There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data.|Jeremy Grantham|Powerful, Challenges, Data 
I am on the board of corporations who contribute both to environmental problems and their solutions. And I am on the NGO side: the Earth Council and other organizations.|Maurice Strong|I Am, Problems, Earth 
One of the things that I've always thought I would like to do is to develop an environmental index. Then people can measure their own environmental performance on an index as they do in other ways.|Maurice Strong|Thought, Performance, People 
Ted Turner is still a leader. And he sets a great example. His ability financially has been reduced, but his influence and his example still is an important asset to the whole environmental movement.|Maurice Strong|Leader, Great, Influence 
I want to work on environmental issues.|Jimmy Gomez|Work, Want, Issues 
Why should we not expect self-designated environmental leaders to practice what they preach?|David Frum|Practice, Why, Leaders

I decided that now is the time to start doing the things that really interest me and I find important. It was in the 10 years of the MacArthur grant that I began working on my first book... and I began putting more work into environmental history.|Jared Diamond|Work, Time, History 
Federal elections happen every two years in this country. Presidential elections every four years. And four years just isn't long enough to dismantle all the environmental laws we've got in this country.|Jared Diamond|Long, Country, Laws

If you cut down a forest, it doesn't matter how many sawmills you have if there are no more trees.|Susan George|Forest, Trees, You 
There's so many issues tied to the meat industry. I mean, social, environmental, humanitarian - all of them. I know that when I'm eating that I'm not hurting the planet, I'm not hurting other people on this planet, I'm not hurting animals... and I'm not hurting nature.|Maggie Q|Nature, People, Animals 
I don't know anything about propaganda for Chinese reunification. I only know about charity and environmental work. I just want to do good.|Chen Guangbiao|Work, Good, Charity 
There are nuclear weapons in China, Iran, Korea and Pakistan. It wouldn't take much to send a couple of warheads off on this planet somewhere that would cause a lot of environmental damage, then if you have got someone who wants to retaliate you have real problems.|Edward James Olmos|Problems, Real, You 
I don't think we're going to save anything if we go around talking about saving plants and animals only we've got to translate that into what's in it for us. |Jim Fowler|Plants, Animals, Think

Maintaining healthy forests is essential to those who make a living from the land and for those of us who use them for recreational purposes.|Cathy McMorris Rodgers|Healthy, Living, Land 
At the same time the folk boom was happening, the civil rights movement was happening, the anti-war movement was happening, the ban the bomb movement was happening, the environmental movement was happening. There was suddenly a generation ready to change the course of history.|Arlo Guthrie|Change, Time, History 
Energy cogeneration on Capitol Hill makes economic and environmental sense and should be pursued for those reasons.|Ander Crenshaw|Energy, Hill, Economic 
Vegetarians have been around for a very long time - Pythagoreans forbade eating animals more than 2,500 years ago - but even as the environmental evidence mounted, they didn't appear to be winning the argument.|Tristram Stuart|Time, Winning, Animals 
It is all very well for 2% of the population to live in a monastic state of meatlessness while everyone else gorges their way towards environmental meltdown or the nearest heart clinic. Vegetarianism is good for the willing minority, but not much use as a campaign tool.|Tristram Stuart|Good, Heart, Live 
Determining the value of individual texts has been an ideological scuffle in literary criticism for centuries: but the environmental cost of printing them hauls this dispute from the ivory tower into day-to-day decision-making. Is it right to write? The publishing industry is slowly beginning to commit to using sustainably harvested trees.|Tristram Stuart|Value, Beginning, Trees 
Our work on light bulbs wasn't an arbitrary mandate. We didn't just pick a standard out of the air, or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility. Instead, we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable.|Fred Upton|Work, Light, Science 
Without international participation, jobs and emissions will simply shift overseas to countries that require few, if any, environmental protections, harming the global environment as well as the U.S. economy.|Fred Upton|Environment, Participation 
More than ever before, there is a global understanding that long-term social, economic, and environmental development would be impossible without healthy families, communities, and countries.|Gro Harlem Brundtland|Impossible, Healthy 
I reflect back 35 years ago, and look how far we have come in America with our environmental policy to improve the conditions of our air and water, and we have had some real successes.|Jay Inslee|Water, America, Look 
We had some major successes and we did so because the country embraced the spirit of Earth Day and embraced this concept that we have to have forward-looking, visionary environmental policy and energy policy in this country.|Jay Inslee|Day, Energy, Earth 
In this country, the health concerns and the environmental concerns are as deep as in Europe. All the surveys show that. But here, we didn't have the cultural dimension. This is a fast-food culture.|Jeremy Rifkin|Health, Deep, Culture 
The position I took at the time was that we hadn't really examined any of the potential environmental consequences of introducing genetically modified organisms.|Jeremy Rifkin|Time, Potential 
We can have technology, prosperity, nice homes and cars, but at the same time we must be conscious of what we are dumping into the water, the air and our food.|Kevin Richardson|Time, Technology, Food 
I wanted to help raise awareness, so I created an environmental foundation called Just Within Reach.|Kevin Richardson|Help, Foundation, Reach 
Unless we keep this planet healthy, everything else is for naught.|Victoria Principal|Healthy, Everything, Planet 
There is a new wave of environmental consumers I like to call Pocketbook Environmentalists. They're going green primarily because it makes good financial sense, but the fact that it benefits their families' health and the environment also makes them feel good.|Lynn Jurich|Good, Health, Financial 
With the observable fact that scientific knowledge makes our lives better when applied with concern for human welfare and environmental protection, there is no question that science and technology can produce abundance so that no one has to go without.|Jacque Fresco|Knowledge, Technology 
I was surprised to see how much the mainstream environmental movement hates the ELF.|Marshall Curry|See, Movement, Surprised 
I have a pretty positive view of environmental activism, but I didn't know much about the ELF. A lot of people make documentaries because they have something they want to say, but I make them because there's something I want to explore.|Marshall Curry|Positive, People, Want 
I've been a philanthropist for all my life, and... I've had many involvements in humanitarian and environmental issues.|Julian Lennon|Life, My Life, Issues 
We'll continue to see more and more brands integrate social causes, charitable components and environmental issues as underlying themes to their campaigns and messaging. Humans connect with humans after all, and brands are using this as a point of connection to engage with their audience, especially charity-minded Generation Y.|Amy Jo Martin|Generation, See, Connection 
Under the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star Program, homes are independently verified to be measurably more energy efficient than average houses.|Melissa Bean|Energy, Houses, Protection 
A fascinating challenge facing today's environmental movement is how to best approach the reversal of past decisions that altered once-pristine environmental spaces for the sake of urgent man-made needs.|Matt Gonzalez|Best, Today, Challenge 
Some types of environmental restoration projects are well-known; restored wetlands, for instance, or coal mine reclamation projects. Recently though, larger dam removal projects have started, a number of them in Washington state.|Matt Gonzalez|Washington, Number, Started 
On the environmental front there's concern about global warming and high levels of carbon dioxide, and trees take in CO2 and store carbon.|Clive Anderson|Trees, Global Warming 
I don't know of a single park without serious environmental problems.|Michael Frome|Problems, Know, Park 
The high prices also highlight the fact that the U.S. is too heavily dependent on fossil fuels that we import from unstable parts of the world. To protect our national security, we must become more energy secure.|Dan Lipinski|World, Energy, Security 
The environmental benefits of hydrogen are also outstanding. When used as an energy source, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water. Zero polluting emissions, an amazing advance over the current sources of energy that we use.|Dan Lipinski|Water, Amazing, Energy 
Hydrogen holds great promise to meet many of our future energy needs, and it addresses national security and our environmental concerns. Hydrogen is the simplest, most abundant element in the universe.|Dan Lipinski|Future, Great, Universe 
Why are ecologists and environmentalists so feared and hated? This is because in part what they have to say is new to the general public, and the new is always alarming.|Garrett Hardin|Why, New, Say 
Moreover, the practical recommendations deduced from ecological principles threaten the vested interests of commerce; it is hardly surprising that the financial and political power created by these investments should be used sometimes to suppress environmental impact studies.|Garrett Hardin|Power, Financial, Political 
I'm very concerned for the future of the earth and its amazing creatures. We've got to be careful and make sure we don't foul our own nest.|John Lithgow|Future, Amazing, Earth 
If we talk about the environment, for example, we have to talk about environmental racism - about the fact that kids in South Central Los Angeles have a third of the lung capacity of kids in Santa Monica.|Danny Glover|Racism, Environment, Kids 
The irony of environmental opposition to the Keystone XL project is that stopping the pipeline to the U.S. will not stop production in the oil sands of Canada. Instead of coming to the United States, the oil will still be produced and shipped by rail or a pipeline similar to the Keystone XL to Canada's Pacific Coast.|John Hoeven|Canada, Irony, Oil 
We learned that economic growth and environmental protection can and should go hand in hand.|Christopher Dodd|Growth, Economic, Protection 
Unless action is taken soon - unless we can display the same vision of that earlier period - we will lose the treasure of California's open space and environmental beauty.|Adam Schiff|Beauty, Vision, Space 
The Body Shop Foundation is run by our staff and supports social activism and environmental activism. We don't tend to support big agencies.|Anita Roddick|Support, Body, Foundation 
Religious and spiritual leaders should be held accountable for environmental activism, not only because they have access to large communities and can influence votes, but because service is integral to religious and spiritual life.|Radhanath Swami|Life, Service, Spiritual 
Businesses can lead with their values and make money, too. You don't have to simply be purely profit-driven. You can integrate social and environmental concerns into a business, be a caring business, be a generous business and still do very well financially.|Jerry Greenfield|Business, Money, Caring 
Look at your business and the activities that you undertake. Then, start to think about not just your economic concerns, but about social and environmental impacts that businesses have.|Jerry Greenfield|Business, Start, Think 
I think the government has to reposition environment on top of their national and international priorities.|Brian Mulroney|Government, Environment 
We created the Cabinet Committee on the Environment to review the environmental implications of all government initiatives. I think what made us successful was the fact that it was a sustained approach. We did something new every year.|Brian Mulroney|Government, Successful 
There is no question that photography has played a major role in the environmental movement.|Galen Rowell|Photography, Question 
These days, most nature photographers are deeply committed to the environmental message.|Galen Rowell|Nature, Message, Committed 
There is no larger collective-action problem than the environment. The three biggest lies of the environmental movement is that every little bit helps, you can do your part, and together we can do it.|Clay Shirky|Together, Problem 
This Nation has realized significant environmental improvements over the last three decades.|Jerry Costello|Nation, Three, Last 
Like I said, I'm more worried long term about the environmental issues then the use of arms.|Hans Blix|Long, Said, Like

I had never been able to get a car that said how much I cared about the environment until I drove electric.|Alexandra Paul|Car, Environment, Said 
My idea of an amusement park story is getting adventurers to go tour environmental disaster areas. After all, if the entire Great Barrier Reef gets killed, which seems like an extremely lively possibility, what are you going to do with all that rotting limestone?|Bruce Sterling|Great, Story, You 
I assume we will have figured out a way to efficiently utilize solar energy and tied that to an efficient way to use nuclear energy in such a way that it doesn't pose a serious environmental issue.|John Hickenlooper|Energy, Way, Solar 
There's no longer any surprise in noting that China has grave environmental problems.|James Fallows|Problems, Surprise, Grave 
Environmental disaster is the gravest threat to China's continued development. That's according to me, but it is not some wacko view.|James Fallows|Me, View, Development

We have very strong environmental laws in the United States and elsewhere around the world. The problem is that they're seldom enforced.|Robert Kennedy, Jr.|Strong, World, Problem 
I always knew that I was going be an environmental advocate when I was very young.|Robert Kennedy, Jr.|Young, Going, Always 
It's obvious nonsense, but it makes nice people feel good about themselves to do their bit for the planet. It's vanity of a grotesque kind to believe that mankind, and our 'carbon footprint', has more impact on the future of Earth than Nature, which bends our planet to its will, as it sees fit.|Charles Saatchi|Nature, Future, Good 
But, as environment minister, I am very interested in a thriving German automobile industry, because I can only pay for the rising costs of environmental protection at home and abroad if there are people in Germany with jobs and who pay taxes.|Sigmar Gabriel|Home, I Am, People 
If there are more and more environmental refugees, they are going to end up on your doorstep too.|Nina Fedoroff|End, Up, Going 
Watching cold fusion is like watching water boil in slow motion. First, sufficient deuterium has to penetrate the palladium electrode. This can take a few weeks. Then, if excess heat is generated during the next month or two, accurate temperature readings require extreme precautions to exclude environmental effects.|Charles Platt|Water, Slow, Motion 
Here on Earth, we've found organisms that thrive in environmental conditions we would have once thought uninhabitable. The presence of these extremophiles suggests that life could potentially take hold on worlds other than our own.|Nick Sagan|Life, Thought, Earth 
In today's world, it is no longer unimaginable to think that business can operate - and even thrive - in an environmentally-friendly manner.|Olympia Snowe|Business, Today, World 
My efforts in Congress are guided by the belief that environmental preservation and restoration are a critical part of the legacy we leave to future generations.|Sue Kelly|Future, Legacy, Belief 
So to hope to be able to have peace, to be able to have justice and environmental balance, are consequences of our behavior, not just our intentions.|Godfrey Reggio|Hope, Peace, Justice 
Nevertheless, there is another threat on the horizon. I see this threat in environmentalism which is becoming a new dominant ideology, if not a religion. Its main weapon is raising the alarm and predicting the human life endangering climate change based on man-made global warming.|Vaclav Klaus|Life, Change, Religion 
Environmental protection doesn't happen in a vacuum. You can't separate the impact on the environment from the impact on our families and communities.|Jim Clyburn|Impact, Environment, You 
What causes autism? As far as we know in 2013, there is no single gene or single environmental factor that accounts for the more than 1 million Americans with ASDs.|Thomas R. Insel|Know, Single, Autism 
Of the 55 refineries closed in America in the last 10 years, they were all closed for economic reasons, mostly oil company mergers. Not a single one was closed for environmental purposes or objections.|Peter DeFazio|America, Company, Oil 
For businesses, biomimicry is about bringing a new discipline - biology - to the design table. It's not to write an environmental impact statement, as most biologists in business do right now.|Janine Benyus|Business, Design, Discipline 
Practically every environmental problem we have can be traced to our addiction to fossil fuels, primarily oil.|Dennis Weaver|Problem, Addiction, Oil 
Local innovation and initiative can help us better understand how to protect our environment.|Gale Norton|Innovation, Help 
Why has it seemed that the only way to protect the environment is with heavy-handed government regulation?|Gale Norton|Government, Environment, Why 
If we don't continue to pursue alternative, emissions-free energy sources like nuclear fuel, we are at risk of increasing our dependence on costly natural gas.|Judy Biggert|Risk, Energy, Natural 
Environmental activists in the rough Antarctic seas have launched a new tool in the fight to stop a Japanese operation to kill hundreds of whales: remote-controlled drones.|Jonathan Franklin|Fight, Stop, New 
With my biology degree, I got this job at an environmental lab. We tested sewage runoff, we tested chemical warfare waste runoff. It's a job I'll never do again and I would never wish upon anybody.|Dustin Lynch|Job, Wish, Biology 
A variety of factors contribute to the price of gasoline in the United States. These factors include worldwide supply, demand and competition for crude oil, taxes, regional differences in access to gasoline supplies and environmental regulations.|Gary Miller|Competition, Differences 
It is extremely important to me that the social and environmental issues associated with the production of fashion clothing are addressed.|Bonnie Wright|Fashion, Me, Clothing

We all recognize that in recent decades, many important achievements have helped create a cleaner, healthier environment, yet our national needs in environmental health are not being fully met.|Samuel Wilson|Health, Environment 
The infrastructure for linking environmental health and public health is not working as well as it should.|Samuel Wilson|Health, Working 
Moreover, environmental health at the local level has become narrowly focused, very much defined around regulations and the attendant regulatory debates.|Samuel Wilson|Health, Focused, Become 
Mankind is considered (by the radical environmentalists) the lowest and the meanest of all species and is blamed for everything.|Dixie Lee Ray|Mankind, Everything, Radical 
I find it interesting that many of the people who want to restrict fossil fuels live in well-developed countries where abundant and affordable energy is readily available.|Lee R. Raymond|People, Live, Want 
In fact, because of their connection to the land, farmers do more to protect and preserve our environment than almost anyone else. They are some of the best environmentalists around.|Ike Skelton|Best, Environment

This whole idea that we address environmental issues by not doing stuff just doesn't work.|Natalie Jeremijenko|Work, Doing, Idea 
We should restore a proper balance in environmental regulation and energy production that is based on common sense, not political agendas.|Mac Thornberry|Balance, Political, Energy 
If your DNA profile puts you at a higher risk of developing obesity, that doesn't mean it's your fate. You can take control of the environmental side of the equation and reduce your overall lifetime risk by a lot.|David Agus|Risk, Control, Fate 
You begin to see that all of these things are connected: The kind of cuts that mean less environmental protection are also the kind of cuts that mean less musical education for the schools and that also mean more overcrowded schools.|Robert Hass|Education, You, See 
I would say Gary Snyder, who is from my part of the world as a poet and environmental thinker, will be read just as Henry Thoreau as John Muir will continue to be read.|Robert Hass|World, Say, Will 
Having yet another vote on refinery legislation that uses high oil prices as an excuse to weaken environmental protections and to give more legislative gifts to the oil industry is misguided in the extreme.|Sherwood Boehlert|Vote, Oil, Gifts 
Let me start by emphasizing that I am open to efforts to expedite environmental procedures for true emergencies or in other clear cases where current laws are needlessly burdensome.|Sherwood Boehlert|I Am, Start, Me 
Well, for starters, we have to do more to create demand for new technologies that can reduce our dependence on foreign oil and environmental degradation.|Sherwood Boehlert|Oil, New, Create 
What I see are people who want affordable energy. They want strong environmental standards - they want a lot of things - but first and foremost they want affordable energy. And if you want affordable energy, you want oil, gas and coal.|John S. Watson|Strong, People, Want 
If you look around the world, the countries with the best environmental practices are the wealthiest. There's a reason for that. If you're worried about where your next meal is going to come from or shelter over your head, your focus is on those things.|John S. Watson|Best, Focus, World 
I tell my environmental friends that they have won. Every issue we look at from an energy perspective is now also looked at from an environmental perspective.|Joe Barton|Friends, Perspective, Energy 
The potential in many environmental issues is that if you undertake corrective action without appropriate understanding of the problem, then you wind up doing more harm than good.|Hugh Ross|Good, Wind, Problem 
At Current, television is all we do - that's our business. We don't have amusement parks I have to worry about, we don't have environmental cases against us, we don't have a series of outdoor-advertising companies.|Keith Olbermann|Business, Worry, Television 
The problem with holistic management is it's so profoundly simple, but it's not easy. And it's profoundly simple. You're almost insulting people's intelligence to explain it twice, just about making better decisions of where you want to go in your life, bringing in environmental, social, economic issues simultaneously.|Allan Savory|Life, Management 
Environmentalism is a form of pagan fundamentalism. These green wackos are fanatics like al-Quaida. Just like them.|G. Gordon Liddy|Green, Just, Like 
If Canada could simply apply the basic principles of sustainable development, such as the internalization of costs and 'polluters pay,' it would have long-term beneficial effects, both environmental and economic.|Andrew Nikiforuk|Canada, Development 
I believe that it is impossible to stop people from using the fossil fuels, so we need to develop technologies which allow us to use them without creating environmental havoc on the planet.|Klaus Lackner|Believe, Impossible, People 
Fossil fuels will run out not because of limited resources but because of the environmental impact. If I can solve that impact, I have basically increased the resource base by a vast amount.|Klaus Lackner|Impact, Run, Resources 
It is one of the issues that will have to be worked through however let me make the point and I think anyone would accept that if you set it up properly, not only will you get better environmental outcomes, you have a chance to create more wealth with the available resource.|John Anderson|Chance, Me, Wealth 
But my point is that you design something in the end that precludes any unhealthy trading practices that are not going to serve your environmental or your economic objectives but now is not the time to do it.|John Anderson|Time, Design, End 
Time after time we're told corporations should have freedom from pesky job safety regulations, environmental protections and labor standards - giving working people the freedom to be crushed in collapsing mines, choke on filthy air and get paid too little to live on.|Richard Trumka|Time, Freedom, Safety 
Mother Nature comes up against reality, and the reality is that the system doesn't work.|John Garamendi|Work, Nature, Mother 
There are more effective ways of tackling environmental problems including global warming, proliferation of plastics, urban sprawl, and the loss of biodiversity than by treaties, top-down regulations, and other approaches offered by big governments and their dependents.|Preston Manning|Loss, Problems 
I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much it's used the apocalyptic tone too much it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out. |Edward Burtynsky|Positive, Trying, Think

Sustainable South Bronx advocates for environmental justice through sustainable environmental and economic development projects.|Majora Carter|Justice, Development 
Autoimmunity is probably the next frontier. The majority of cases of autoimmune disease result from a complex genetic problem that has environmental influences.

My favorite records are, like, The Pretty Things' 'Parachute' and 'S.F. Sorrow' and The Mothers of Invention's 'We're Only in It for the Money' and The Kinks' 'Village Green Preservation Society' - these records that have a story - even if it's not a literal story - because of how they're sequenced and flow.

A rat race is for rats. We're not rats. We're human beings.

You cannot reform your society or institution without opening your mind.|Bashar al-Assad|Mind, You, Opening 
My fellow Americans, you have to decide what kind of country you want to live in. If you want a you're on your own, winner take all society you should support the Republican ticket.

White folks, no matter how well-meaning or open-minded, have no true idea what it's like to be black in America. That's not a slam against white people or an accusation of latent bigotry. But the fact is that we all live in an Anglo-dominated society.|John Ridley|America, People, Black

In just about every area of society, there's nothing more important than ethics.|Henry Paulson|Ethics, Important, Nothing

You can't gaze in the crystal ball and see the future. What the Internet is going to be in the future is what society makes it.|Bob Kahn|Future, Internet, You

It is our responsibility to explain to the public how an often unpredictable system of justice is one that serves a productive, civilized, but always evolving, society.|Sonia Sotomayor|Justice, Responsibility

And most of us feel it.|Marianne Williamson|Depression, Think, Feel 
When the Soviet Union fell, optimistic scholars believed the world had shifted inexorably in the direction of free markets and liberal democracy.

If capitalism is to remain a healthy, vibrant economic system, corporations must participate in taking care of the society and the environment in which they live.|Simon Mainwaring|Live, Healthy, Environment

Stabilizing the euro is one thing, healing the culture that surrounds it is another. A world in which material values are everything and spiritual values nothing is neither a stable state nor a good society. The time has come for us to recover the Judeo-Christian ethic of human dignity in the image of God.|Jonathan Sacks|Time, Good, Culture 
Issues such as transparency often boil down to which side of - pick a number - 40 you're on. Under 40, and transparency is generally considered a good thing for society.

Awareness in our society has flipped all types of injustice on its head.|Serj Tankian|Injustice, Awareness, Head

Terror will crash down on us if we fail to understand that a pluralistic society requires the personal and daily commitment of every citizen.|Tariq Ramadan|Daily, Commitment, Down 
The very moment you understand that being a Muslim and being American or European are not mutually exclusive, you enrich your society.

Usually my ideas for work have revolved around my interest in people, especially people that live on the edges of society.|Mary Ellen Mark|Work, Ideas, People

Indeed, one important source of this Anglo-Saxon distaste for highbrows and eggheads was the French revolution, which was seen as an attempt to reconstruct society on the basis of abstract rational principles.|Terry Eagleton|Revolution, Principles 
Why is it that here in the United States we have such difficulty even imagining a different sort of society from the one whose dysfunctions and inequalities trouble us so?|Tony Judt|Why, Trouble, Difficulty 
Comedy is a reflection. We create nothing. We set no styles, no standards. We're reflections. It's a distorted mirror in the fun house. We watch society. As society behaves, then we have the ability to make fun of it.|Alan King|Reflection, Mirror, Fun 
Unfortunately, our affluent society has also been an effluent society.|Hubert H. Humphrey|Been, Affluent

Human rights commissions, as they are evolving, are an attack on our fundamental freedoms and the basic existence of a democratic society... It is in fact totalitarianism. I find this is very scary stuff.|Stephen Harper|Rights, Human, Existence 
I think that, too many times, business has been seen as acting in its narrow self-interest rather than, essentially, contributing more broadly to society.

They are looking for a broader social purpose and want to work somewhere that has such a purpose.|Michael Porter|Work, Value, Purpose

I'm sure mothers are important across every culture, but particularly in Korean society, the role of the mother is of great importance.|Bong Joon-ho|Culture, Great, Mother

Our kids are actually doing what we told them to do when they sit in front of that TV all day or in front of that computer game all day. The society is telling kids unconsciously that nature's in the past. It really doesn't count anymore, that the future is in electronics, and besides, the bogeyman is in the woods.|Richard Louv|Nature, Future, Day 
Growth is a panacea for many ills in society; not entirely, but many.|P. Chidambaram|Growth, Many, Panacea

We are shifting from a managerial society to an entrepreneurial society.|John Naisbitt|Shifting, Entrepreneurial

It is good for society to have this introspection.|Jacques Verges|Good, Introspection 
Profit is the sole criterion used by the establishment to evaluate economic activity. From the rat race to lame ducks. The vocabulary in vogue is a give-away. It's more reminiscent of a human menagerie than human society.|Jimmy Reid|Profit, Human, Economic

Justice delayed is justice denied.|William E. Gladstone|Justice, Delayed, Denied 
Well, when I think of steroids I think of an image. You have the advantage over someone, which is a form of cheating. I guess it wouldn't be right unless it was legal for everybody.

More law, less justice.|Marcus Tullius Cicero|Justice, Law, More

Common sense often makes good law.|William O. Douglas|Good, Law, Common Sense 
Let me remind you that nuclear disarmament is not just an ardent desire of the people, as expressed in many resolutions of the United Nations.

No one can doubt that the sufferings of the sober, virtuous woman, in legal subjection to the mastership of a drunken, immoral husband and father over herself and children, not only from physical abuse, but from spiritual shame and humiliation, must be such as the man himself can not possibly comprehend.|Susan B. Anthony|Children, Father, Spiritual

I'm trusting in the Lord and a good lawyer.|Oliver North|Good, Lawyer, Lord 
That which is not just is not law.|William Lloyd Garrison|Law, Just, Which

The legal battle against segregation is won, but the community battle goes on.|Dorothy Day|Community, Battle

It is right to give every man his due.|Plato|Man, Right, Give

The keystone to justice is the belief that the legal system treats all fairly.|Janet Reno|Justice, Belief, System 
The history of American democracy, to say the least, has been checkered. Our nation was founded at a time when people of African descent were held in bondage. After slavery was abolished, they were forced to endure legal discrimination for another 100 years.|Bernie Sanders|Time, History, American 
I did a little bit of acting - some guest spots here and there. I got a job working as a therapist doing individual and group crisis intervention and family therapy. I did that for two years. I left to do 'Boston Legal.' So my psychology career has been interwoven into my acting career, and it's my safety net and fallback.|Meredith Eaton|Family, Safety, Job

Being a justice. If you love law the way I do... you're given the job of a lifetime... you're permitted to address the most important legal questions of the country, and sometimes the world. And in doing so, you make a difference in people's lives.|Sonia Sotomayor|Love, Justice, Law 
There will be gay couples; it will exist. It is not very nice that people who are married - who divorce in three seconds - don't want protection for the others. The legal system should protect everyone, not just the few people who think they are above everybody else because they are married.|Karl Lagerfeld|People, Divorce, Nice 
You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.|Marco Rubio|Future, Support, American 
We will have to accept a certain degree of legal immigration; that's globalisation... In the era of the smartphone, we cannot shut ourselves away... people know full well how we live in Europe.|Angela Merkel|People, Live, Know 
It would be a sign of society changing if we did finally legalize prostitution. Once it's legal, it doesn't mean your daughter's going to run out and be a ho. The more we sort of bring these things into the light, you bring these hidden vices into the light, the less power they have over our society. You make it legal, it tends to go away.|Thomas Jane|Light, Daughter, Power 
No country could claim to be civilized if its legal system weren't available to everyone in it.|Sydney Pollack|Country, Everyone, System

There are half a billion people that listen to music online and the vast majority are doing so illegally. But if we bring those people over to the legal side and Spotify, what is going to happen is we are going to double the music industry and that will lead to more artists creating great new music.|Daniel Ek|Music, Great, People 
The legal right of the Southern people to reclaim their fugitives I have constantly admitted. The legal right of Congress to interfere with their institution in the states, I have constantly denied.|Abraham Lincoln|People, Right, Congress 
Public confidence in, and support for, the euro - and, indeed, the European Union - will ultimately be determined by how well we deliver on growth and jobs rather than on institutional wrangling and complex legal or technical negotiations.|Enda Kenny|Confidence, Growth, Support 
Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.|Mike Pompeo|Surveillance, Should

In countries with a properly functioning legal system, the mob continues to exist, but it is rarely called upon to mete out capital punishment. The right to take human life belongs to the state. Not so in societies where weak courts and poor law enforcement are combined with intractable structural injustices.|Teju Cole|Life, Law, Human

There are millions of people who consume music illegally every month. Just getting them into a legal service will make the music industry way bigger than it's ever been before.|Daniel Ek|Music, Service, People 
I've led a school whose faculty and students examine and discuss and debate every aspect of our law and legal system. And what I've learned most is that no one has a monopoly on truth or wisdom. I've learned that we make progress by listening to each other, across every apparent political or ideological divide.|Elena Kagan|Wisdom, Truth, School 
Outside of the Constitution we have no legal authority more than private citizens, and within it we have only so much as that instrument gives us. This broad principle limits all our functions and applies to all subjects.|Andrew Johnson|Constitution, Limits 
Unlike national legal systems, there are precious few avenues to address judicial activism at the WTO. You pretty much have to gain consensus to change the agreements, or simply withdraw from the system. The first is nearly impossible, and the second would be - in the view of many - cataclysmic.|Robert Lighthizer|Change, Impossible, View 
Death Row inmates are almost twice as expensive to house each year as other inmates. Death penalty trials are much costlier than trials where execution is not a potential punishment and consume more time from judges, public defenders, and other legal personnel.|Reid Hoffman|Time, Death, Potential 
One of the things I was taught in law school is that I'd never be able to think the same again - that being a lawyer is something that's part of who I am as an individual now.|Anita Hill|School, Law, I Am 
Lawyers spend a great deal of their time shoveling smoke.|Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Time, Great, Lawyers 
Now a slave is not 'held' by any legal contract, obligation, duty, or authority, which the laws will enforce. He is 'held' only by brute force. One person beats another until the latter will obey him, work for him, if he require it, or do nothing if he require it.|Lysander Spooner|Work, Authority, Slave 
Yes, the state must intervene to prevent the exploitation of poor Indian women who are enticed or coerced into surrogacy, as well as to protect the rights of surrogate children. However, it should also be empathetic to individuals with alternative lifestyles who are well within their legal and human rights to demand access to surrogacy services.|Kapil Sibal|Children, Women, Rights 
We have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.|Marco Rubio|Family, Why, You 
I believe we can, and must, strike a balance between our shared American values of religious liberty and freedom from discrimination. My concerns lie with the possible consequences of politically-driven legislation which claims to promote religious liberty but instead rolls back the legal protections held by LGBT Americans.|Gary Johnson|Freedom, Balance, American 
The memory of the 146 people who lost their lives in the Triangle Shirtwaist fire stands as a reminder that legal protections and workplace safety standards were won through a long struggle for social justice and at great human cost.|Eric Schneiderman|Great, Struggle, Justice 
Places where prostitution is legal, you find much better health care, fewer cases of disease and illegal abortions. There's really nothing to be gained by keeping prostitution illegal.|Thomas Jane|Health, Better, Care 
I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the President.|Sally Yates|Law, Believe, Constitution 
I'm not a lawyer, and maybe I should have used more specific legal language.|Sonny Bono|Language, Lawyer, Maybe

Farming with live animals is a 7 day a week, legal form of slavery.|George Segal|Day, Week, Slavery 
Recently a study proved that working from a larger, less cluttered computer screen increases concentration. I could have told them that. And yes, I write first drafts with a mechanical pencil and a yellow legal pad. There's good reason for this primitive behavior: I am a crackerjack typist. My hand moves far more quickly than my brain.|Stacy Schiff|Good, I Am, Behavior 
Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.|Charles Lamb|Children, Lawyers, Once 
I would say that IQ is the strongest predictor of which field you can get into and hold a job in, whether you can be an accountant, lawyer or nurse, for example.|Daniel Goleman|Job, Lawyer, You 
While the Census Bureau already has a legal obligation to keep people's information confidential, we all know that in an age of cyber attacks and computer hacking that ensuring people's privacy can be difficult.|Jeff Duncan|Age, Information, People 
The legal system is often a mystery, and we, its priests, preside over rituals baffling to everyday citizens.|Henry Miller|Mystery, System, Rituals 
It is not unprofessional to give free legal advice, but advertising that the first visit will be free is a bit like a fox telling chickens he will not bite them until they cross the threshold of the hen house.|Warren E. Burger|Advertising, Advice, Free 
We owe the Aboriginal peoples a debt that is four centuries old. It is their turn to become full partners in developing an even greater Canada. And the reconciliation required may be less a matter of legal texts than of attitudes of the heart.|Romeo LeBlanc|Heart, Canada, Debt 
Unless you have a perception of who you are as a lawyer, you will never be at ease in dealing with legal matters, clients, or courts. But if you know who you are and why you're there, all you need is the expertise and the information.|Samuel Dash|Perception, Information 
So the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund is out there preserving and fighting for, and sometimes winning and sometimes losing, the fight for First Amendment rights in comics and, more generally, for freedom of speech.|Neil Gaiman|Freedom, Winning, Book 
I remember when I took Quentin Tarantino with me to a very private screening of the documentary 'Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,' which shows some of the legal irregularities of his case. I was involved by the film, and it was an amazing experience to see people weep at the end of it.|Harvey Weinstein|Experience, Amazing, Me 
A potlatch is similar to a court case in that both are prohibitively expensive; both involve lengthy speeches and the vigorous examination and debate of the actions, rights and legal responsibilities of the participants. One has food, singing and spiritual rites; the other, not so much.|Eden Robinson|Food, Spiritual, Singing 
Nothing is so unproductive as the law. It is expensive whether you win or lose.|Gilbert Parker|Law, Win, Win Or Lose 
I have been committed to carrying out my duties... in accordance with both the letter and spirit of all applicable rules of ethics and canons of conduct.|Samuel Alito|Ethics, Rules, Committed 
Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11 has been carried out by an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, not by recent immigrants or by refugees. So tamping down immigration won't fix the real issue, which is 'homegrown' terrorism.|Peter L. Bergen|American, Terrorism 
Those who challenge the law in one or another of its aspects weaken the whole legal structure of society. For one man to disobey a law he does not like is to invite others to disobey another law which he may regard as indispensable to his own livelihood - or life.|Robert Kennedy|Life, Challenge, Law 
As legal residents, immigrants would contribute more in taxes, spend more at our businesses, start companies of their own and create more jobs. Immigration is not a problem for us to solve but an opportunity for America to seize.|Jose Andres|Opportunity, America 
We need to let the referee's sole thing be to protect the quarterback and get those late hits out of there. They even have a stat on television that says 'knockdowns.' Knockdowns means that you knock him down after he throws the ball. The assumption is, if it's legal, we'll make excuses for them.|John Madden|Excuses, Television, You 
Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior.|Thucydides|Men, Equal, First 
I have always been of opinion that all the political workers should be indifferent and should never bother about the legal fight in the law courts and should boldly bear the heaviest possible sentences inflicted upon them. They may defend themselves but always from purely political considerations and never from a personal point of view.|Bhagat Singh|Law, Fight, Political

We get information in the mail, the regular postal mail, encrypted or not, vet it like a regular news organization, format it - which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do, when you're talking about giant databases of information - release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks.|Julian Assange|Organization, Political

Tori's my legal name. My niece and nephews, they all call me Aunt Ellen, because I went by my middle name years ago, before I turned 18.|Tori Amos|Me, Name, Aunt 
I'm for the DREAM Act. It makes so much sense. Following the implementation of the DREAM Act, we'll have a case study we can point to where we can say that we provided a path to citizenship or legal involvement in the community for these young immigrants, and the sky didn't fall.|Beto O'Rourke|Community, Path, Sky

Don't get me wrong: I can and do waste time on the Internet with the best of them, but in some respects, I am an embarrassingly analog guy. I am not on Facebook. I write whole books on yellow legal pads. I do not own a cell phone.|Jonathan Dee|Time, Best, I Am 
The most interesting legal philosophy is German, so naturally I went to Germany, particularly to Berlin, quite a bit.|Philip Kerr|Philosophy, Interesting 
I researched children's rights, divorce law, and parental kidnapping. Millions of children and parents are touched by the inadequacy of the legal system to deal with the human heart.|Amity Gaige|Children, Parents, Law 
I've worked since it was basically legal to work. I was a waitress on and off for eight years. I worked at Sears; I worked at Abercrombie folding clothes. My dad really instilled good money management habits, and I've saved 10 percent of my paycheck, every paycheck, since I was 15.|Rosanna Pansino|Work, Money, Good

Nearly every study shows that competition from cheap foreign labor undercuts the wages of American workers and legal immigrants.|Lamar S. Smith|Competition, American, Study

There should be a path to earned legal status for those that are here. Not - not amnesty - earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.|Jeb Bush|Time, Path, You 
We have a legal and moral obligation to rid our world of nuclear tests and nuclear weapons.|Ban Ki-moon|World, Moral

I remember being upset because I was finally legal to drink in Canada, and I decided to throw that all away and move to America, where I had to wait another two years. I came here to do improv and to try to join the Groundlings.|Ryan Reynolds|America, Canada, Remember 
While writing, saying, and doing much, Mr. Trump is apologizing for his past sins. He's walking away from supporting abortion, hurling insults and more. Now, America needs to follow suit and apologize for the scourge of legal abortion that has left millions of empty cradles, wombs barren, women's health damaged, and families broken.|Alveda King|Women, Health, Past 
In the U.S., you even lose legal rights if you store your data in a company's machines instead of your own. The police need to present you with a search warrant to get your data from you; but if they are stored in a company's server, the police can get it without showing you anything. They may not even have to give the company a search warrant.|Richard Stallman|Police, Data, Company 
I don't have an issue with whether - from a legal standpoint, with whether or not government can impose the ultimate punishment on people. We do it in capital cases. Police officers shoot fleeing felons.|Trey Gowdy|Government, Police, People 
Our church has been legal since late 1960s. I've been involved since 1972. I was ordained in 1975.|Sally Kirkland|Late, Church, Involved 
Years ago, during a John Grisham phase, I tried to pinpoint exactly why I found Grisham's often predictable legal thrillers quite so comforting. The best answer I could come up with was the frequency with which Grisham tells us that his lead characters are sipping coffee.

Strictly speaking, my interest is not in legal rights for animals but in a change of heart towards animals.|J. M. Coetzee|Change, Heart, Animals

Legal reform in Russia is a must. And I keep track of it daily.|Dmitry Medvedev|Daily, Russia, Must 
I worked as a lawyer as a member of the teaching staff of a technical college and then I worked principally as legal adviser to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party. |Hans Frank|College, Lawyer, Party

To have a .cn domain, you have to be a registered business. You have to prove your site is legal.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Business, You, Prove 
If they lose their legal basis for owning a .cn domain, google.cn would cease to exist, or if it continued to exist, it would be illegal, and doing anything blatantly illegal in China puts their employees at serious risk.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Risk, Employees, Doing 
Yahoo! had a choice. It chose to provide an e-mail service hosted on servers based inside China, making itself subject to Chinese legal jurisdiction. It didn't have to do that. It could have provided a service hosted offshore only.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Service, Choice, China 
Thanks to the Internet in general and social media in particular, the Chinese people now have a mechanism to hold authorities accountable for wrongdoing - at least sometimes - without any actual political or legal reforms having taken place.

There isn't much question that the person who obtained the WikiLeaks cables from a classified U.S. government network broke U.S. law and should expect to face the consequences. The legal rights of a website that publishes material acquired from that person, however, are much more controversial.|Rebecca MacKinnon|Law, Government 
I write on big yellow legal pads - ideas in outline form when I'm doing stand-up and stuff. It's vivid that way. I can't type it into an iPad - I think that would put a filter into the process.|Robin Williams|Ideas, Yellow, Think 
If there are people who act outside the law, then the state must use legal means to impose law in the interests of majority. That's the way it's done in the U.S., and that's the way it's done in Russia.|Vladimir Putin|Law, People, Done 
Many foreclosed homes are neglected or abandoned, as legal proceedings or other factors delay their resale. Deteriorating or vacant properties can, in turn, directly affect the quality of life in a neighborhood, for example, by leading to increases in vandalism or crime.|Ben Bernanke|Life, Quality, Neighborhood

There is a deep connection, when we're talking about certain market forces and a legal structure that inhibits low or moderate income families from getting ahead. Eviction is part of a business model at the bottom of the market.|Matthew Desmond|Business, Deep, Connection 
National data on evictions aren't collected, although national data on foreclosures are. And so if anyone wants to, kind of, get to know any statistical research about evictions, they have to really dig in the annals of legal records.|Matthew Desmond|Research, Data, Know 
We should make it as easy as possible to be able to get a legal work visa - not citizenship, not a green card. Just a work visa, with a background check and a Social Security card so that applicable taxes would get paid.|Gary Johnson|Work, Green, Easy 
Some officials overseeing local water systems have tried to go above and beyond what is legally required. But they have encountered resistance, sometimes from the very residents they are trying to protect, who say that if their water is legal, it must be safe.|Charles Duhigg|Water, Trying, Resistance

There's a security, a validity of knowing that it's legal. It's hard to put into words. It's just a feeling, I guess - something about saying vows in front of the people around you who love and support you.|Matt Bomer|Love, Support, Words 
We believe that government in Britain is there to protect people from terrorism and from the worst criminality, but never at the expense of our civil liberties and the basic tenets of our legal system.|Charles Kennedy|Government, Believe, People

We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.

In 1987, I had my first opportunity to provide 'advice and consent' on a Supreme Court nominee. At that time, I stated that the qualifications essential for evaluating a nominee for the bench included 'integrity, character, legal competence and ability, experience, and philosophy and judicial temperament.' On that test, Elena Kagan fails.|John McCain|Time, Integrity, Experience 
On the issue of the gay marriage, I believe if people want to have private ceremonies, that's fine. I do not believe that gay marriages should be legal.|John McCain|Marriage, Believe, People 
Botswana had three successive good presidents who served their legal terms, who did well for their countries - three, not one.|Mo Ibrahim|Good, Three, Well 
I say the law should be blind to race, gender and sexual orientation, just as it claims to be blind to wealth and power.

In Texas, it's legal for a kid to be in a bar with your parents.|Maren Morris|Parents, Texas, Kid

I have been surrounded by some of the smartest, brightest, most caring lawyers, by agents who are willing to risk their lives for others, by support staff that are willing to work as hard as they can.|Janet Reno|Work, Caring, Support 
I think, clearly, where you have a situation in which the Solicitor General tells me, 'I cannot in good faith argue a certainly legal position,' and if the president told us to argue that position, we would have to tell him, 'No, we can't do that, Mr. President.'|Janet Reno|Good, Faith, Me 
The military tribunals currently underway at Guantanamo Bay create a clear legal process, as affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Hamdi v.

Discerning the legal difference between what WikiLeaks did and what news organizations do is difficult and would set a terrible precedent.|George Packer|Difference, News, Difficult 
If a president can enforce a part of a law and delay a part of a law, then does he have a power to not enforce any law he so chooses? If he can allow illegal aliens to freely run across our border, can he force legal citizens out of the country? Where would be the end of his power?|Marsha Blackburn|Power, Law, End 
Just as Josef K, the protagonist of Kafka's 'The Trial,' awoke one day to discover that he had become part of some unfathomable legal carnival, we, too are frequently waking to discover that the rules of the digital game have once again profoundly changed.|Evgeny Morozov|Day, Rules, Game

In high school - that's when I first fell in love with his music and his voice. 'Blonde on Blonde' above everything. I vaguely remember 'Desire' coming out.

My feminism, as intended by me, extends to empowering women to make legal choices, not to judge the legal choices they make. My fight is for rights.|Maajid Nawaz|Women, Choices, Me 
In today's Britain, the weakest among us are often assumed to be minority communities. In fact, the weakest are those minorities-within-minorities for whom the legal right to exit from their communities' constraints amounts to nothing before the enforcement of cultural and religious shaming.|Maajid Nawaz|Today, Nothing, Right 
These endless legal challenges that define elections in New York are a joke in this country, and they are the reason why it is so expensive, or one of the reasons, it's so expensive to run here and why so many people decide not to run.|Michael Bloomberg|Challenges, New York, People 
We have to get control of our borders. You can only do that if you make companies obey the law and not hire undocumented or illegals.

Russia has gone way beyond its legal powers to use bases in the Crimea.|Jeremy Corbyn|Russia, Way, Gone 
Hillary Clinton is in political trouble and perhaps even legal trouble over her use of private e-mail accounts and bypassing government-issued accounts containing substantial amounts of information that belongs to the federal government.

As self-driving cars become more common, there will be a flood of new legal questions.|Adam Cohen|Questions, New, Will 
My favourite authors are John Grisham and Jeffrey Archer. Grisham rapidly established himself and now completely owns the legal space of fiction writing, something I want to do in financial space. I like Archer because he keeps his readers engaged: every chapter is a page turner, and he keeps his writing simple.|Ravi Subramanian|Writing, Simple, Space 
People travel overseas to do things overseas that aren't legal in Ireland all the time. You know, are we going to stop people going to Las Vegas? Are we going to stop people going to Amsterdam? There are things that are illegal in Ireland, and we don't prevent people from travelling overseas to avail of them.|Leo Varadkar|Travel, Time, People 
When I was fighting, I would look to excite the crowds with a bolo punch or something taunting. Looking back, they were legal - but not sportsmanlike. I don't recommend another boxer try them.

Russia has every reason to dispose of its nuclear arsenal... to suit its interests and international legal obligations.|Sergei Lavrov|Russia, Reason, Suit 
Nobody was like, 'Kimberly, we're going to let you anchor general news or host a show or do any of that.' I at first started out doing legal analysis, but I had to make the case to my bosses... give me a shot, give me a chance, and I was able to do that: say, 'Let me fill in. Let me show you my range. Nothing to lose here - it's the holidays.'|Kimberly Guilfoyle|Holidays, Chance, Me 
If I was applying for a legal position, I would highlight my experience working for the San Francisco-L.A.

The settlers, as we know, are the only people in Israel who take the Left seriously.

Slavery, if it can be legalized at all, can be legalized only by positive legislation. Natural law gives it no aid. Custom imparts to it no legal sanction.|Lysander Spooner|Positive, Law, Slavery 
It cannot be said that the Constitution formed 'the people of the United States,' for all time, into a corporation. It does not speak of 'the people' as a corporation, but as individuals. A corporation does not describe itself as 'we,' nor as 'people,' nor as 'ourselves.' Nor does a corporation, in legal language, have any 'posterity.'|Lysander Spooner|Time, Speak, Constitution 
The mental capacity of a person to make reasonable contracts, is the only criterion, by which to determine his legal capacity to make obligatory contracts.

In America, to be ID'd - sorted, tagged, and permanently filed - is to lose a bit of one's soul. To die a little. This sounds like a subtle, poetic notion. It's not.

One of the things I believe strongly in is developing institutions - legal, press, bureaucracies, academies - that are rooted in the pursuit of impartial truth. That aren't simply just bent to partisan ends or are corrupted for the powerful or for other ulterior motives.|David Grann|Truth, Powerful, Believe 
This pro-choice issue is a legal issue that should be decided by the courts.|Michael T. Flynn|Pro-Choice, Should, Issue 
I mentioned it yesterday: I'm one of these people that - I don't - like, on the abortion issue, it's not something that - I'm very uncomfortable talking about it. I'm not gonna kid you. It's a very uncomfortable thing. I think that it's a legal issue. Definitely a legal issue. It's been decided upon by our Supreme Court.|Michael T. Flynn|People, Think, You 
In the United States, female fisticuffs were marginalized, first as erotic vaudeville in the 19th century and later as serious competition developed in the first half of the 20th. Legal wars waged by boxers in the 1960s and '70s won women the right to compete professionally nationwide.|Katherine Dunn|Women, Competition, Right

One: balance the budget now, not later. Two: Get Americans jobs by ending illegal immigration and making legal immigration harder. Lastly: Impose term limits.|Virgil Goode|Balance, Ending, Budget 
The reality is for 50 years in this country, federal law has required people that are illegal - or that are immigrants - or that are legal immigrants to this country to carry documentation to that effect. And that has been the law for 50 years.|Trent Franks|Law, Reality, People 
I think there's no problem getting through the House a pathway to legal status. A pathway to citizenship is going to be tougher, but I think it is potentially doable, if we can show the American people that the border is secure.|Blake Farenthold|American, People, Problem 
I have a different approach. I don't file lawsuits because I really don't care.|Nicole Kidman|Care, Different, Approach 
The simplest formula for the new conception of morality, which is beginning to be opposed to the moral dogma still esteemed by all society, but especially by the women, might be summed up in these words: Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love.|Ellen Key|Love, Marriage, Women 
When I'm sitting at the desk not being able to write line one, it's silence and despair! It's not so easy to put the pen to the legal pad or type the first sentence on the computer screen.|Erica Jong|Silence, Easy, Pen 
I think 'The Act of Killing' forced people to look at the problem, but the problem is actually a state run by thugs, or a shadow state, a part of the state that's run by thugs, and a military that enjoys complete legal - not just impunity, but immunity.|Joshua Oppenheimer|Shadow, Problem, Military 
Gay marriage is the last bastion of, to me... as a legal, ceremonial, sentimental and religious side, it's one of the last steps. Retaining your job being one of the earlier steps, like, not getting kicked out of your job because you're gay.|Gus Van Sant|Marriage, Job, Me 
We have allowed a situation to develop in which it is legal for a multibillion dollar industry to own, wholly and in perpetuity, the intimate and personal details of children.|Beeban Kidron|Children, Details, Situation 
Again, in Wag the Dog, war has to be declared by an act of congress. But if you go to war, you don't have to declare war. You're just at war and we did that, which is not legal.|Val Kilmer|Dog, War, You 
I know how easy it is for one to stay well within moral, ethical, and legal bounds through the skillful use of words - and to thereby spin, sidestep, circumvent, or bend a truth completely out of shape. To that extent, we are all liars on numerous occasions.|Sidney Poitier|Truth, Words, Easy 
Of all the questions I get asked as an undocumented immigrant in the United States, there are two - asked in various permutations via email, social media or in person - that chill me to the bone: 'Why don't you just make yourself legal?' And: 'Why don't you get in the back of the line?'|Jose Antonio Vargas|Social Media, Yourself 
Britain's legal structure is basically the same as in feudal times: laws are written for the elite.|Heather Brooke|Structure, Same, Laws 
It is already clear that, because of advances in technology, drones are going to play an increased role in warfare in the years ahead. It is therefore vital that the legal frameworks governing their use are robust and internationally recognised.|Douglas Alexander|Technology, Play, Ahead 
I don't believe in amnesty... What I have proposed is that we would come forth with a program that allows individuals to come forward and to plead guilty... They would have to pay a fine they would have to go through a background check - some say learn English - and they would get learned legal status. |Chris Gibson|Believe, Learn, Guilty 
A new book by 'New York Times' reporter Charlie Savage, 'Power Wars,' suggests that there has been little substantive difference between George W.

I love immigrants. Legal, illegal - they're not to be despised.|Mario Cuomo|Love, Immigrants, Illegal 
I think we will have full marriage rights in Colorado. But in 1992, there was a very hateful Amendment 2 that basically made it legal for any institution to deny gays and lesbians access, whether it's hospitals or restaurants or employment. Anybody could fire you or not let you in a restaurant because you were gay.|Martina Navratilova|Marriage, Fire, Restaurant

I chose law because writing was involved. I didn't realize how boring legal writing was, but I even learned to love that.|Marcia Clark|Love, Law, Writing 
State-sanctioned marriage is a civil contract, period. A contract is not a judgment of moral value. It is a legal agreement between two parties that testifies to a meeting of minds between those consenting entities. It is not a religious act or rite and so has nothing to do with Adam and Eve or Steve or even Harvey.|Harvey Fierstein|Marriage, Value, Moral 
In my role as Wikileaks editor, I've been involved in fighting off many legal attacks. To do that, and keep our sources safe, we have had to spread assets, encrypt everything, and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions.|Julian Assange|World, People, Fighting

Allowing for endless legal challenges or partisan political discussions is not the proper way to handle an issue that affects the entire scope of the environment and the economy.|Gene Green|Challenges, Political

In Psalm 72, Solomon prays for power and fame but he says the purpose of influence is to speak up for others and one is the immigrant. He doesn't delineate between legal and illegal.|Rick Warren|Power, Influence, Purpose 
Defining marriage is a power that should be left to the states. Moreover, no state should be forced to recognize a marriage that is not within its own laws, Constitution, and legal precedents.|John Sununu|Marriage, Power 
Americans have grown a great deal more realistic about lawyers and the law. I think that's all for the good. A lot of people will say to you these days, 'If you are looking for justice, don't go to a courtroom.' That's just a more realistic perspective on what happens in the legal process.|Scott Turow|Good, Great, Justice 
People talk of me as being the inventor of the legal thriller.|Scott Turow|Me, People, Talk 
Though I had come into the world on 16 November 1922, my official documents show that I was born two days later, on the 18th. It was thanks to this petty fraud that my family escaped from paying the fine for not having registered my birth at the proper legal time.|Jose Saramago|Family, Time, World

These are people who haven't gone through the legal means to becoming citizens like our forefathers did. They want all the benefits but none of the responsibilities.|Matt Dillon|People, Want, Through 
Relying on the face might be human nature - even babies prefer to look at attractive people. But, of course, judging someone based on the geometry of his features is, from a moral and legal standpoint, no better than judging him based on the color of his skin.|Paul Bloom|Nature, Color, People 
When I was a prosecutor in Kansas City, my job was to fight for justice and safety for all citizens in my community. Equal access to justice under the law is an American value embedded in the fabric of our legal and political system - the idea that anybody, powerful or not, can have their day in court.|Claire McCaskill|Community, Justice, Safety 
Before swearing in new citizens, immigration officials check to make sure prospective citizens weren't on voter rolls or voted before achieving legal citizenship. A citizenship petition can be denied if they were.|Kate Brown|Achieving, Citizenship 
That's one thing I don't think people consider nowadays. They want to believe in the importance of marriage, boil it down to just a signature on a legal document. But that's exactly what it is. If not, why not just get married without one?|Ariel Pink|Marriage, Believe, People 
I do believe that people hire immigrants, legal and illegal immigrants, to do certain jobs that maybe possibly could go to American citizens, and that's unfortunate. If they're here legally, I think it's OK. If they're here illegally, then they ought not be taking jobs from American citizens.|Jan Brewer|American, Believe, People

Yusuf Qaradawi is probably the most well-known legal authority in the whole Muslim world today.|Feisal Abdul Rauf|Today, World, Authority

The evolution of the plaza always came from the idea of just a really good place to ride a skateboard that you could ride at anytime, and that's what the foundation always stands for - being a place that's free, open and legal... for those that are technical, to do really hard stuff, and for those who are learning, to just have fun.|Rob Dyrdek|Learning, Good, Fun 
Opponents of legal birth control, including abortion, have tried for decades to play the race card, saying that legal abortion is racist. What they ignore is that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. accepted the Margaret Sanger Award from Planned Parenthood in 1966.|Karen DeCrow|Control, King, Saying 
I really am not going to get involved in a discussion about the legal position of the Iraq war. I am not the person to do that because I am not sufficiently impartial as a lawyer about this, because it's a matter that is of interest to the person that I am closest to in the world.|Cherie Blair|War, I Am, World 
If I want to make political decisions, I should stand for election. If I want to do something in the legal field, that's different; that is my - they are my qualifications, but you know, the politicians are the ones who stand up there and are answerable to the people.|Cherie Blair|Decisions, Political, People

When then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued me in 2003 over my stewardship as a director of the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE's legal expenses were more than $100 million, which made it perhaps the priciest litigation in the state's history.|Kenneth Langone|History, Me, New York 
One of the reasons Elton and I entered into our partnership - the first day it became legal in Britain to do so - is that we felt it was an opportunity to protect ourselves with official recognition of our relationship.|David Furnish|Relationship, Opportunity 
While Texas women have the right to safe, legal abortion, in reality there are already very few facilities in Texas to provide this essential care. In 2008, 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider.|Wendy Davis|Women, Reality, Care 
A lot of things that we cannot buy and sell in markets used to be totally legal objects of market exchange - human beings when we had slavery, child labour, human organs, and so on. So there is no economic theory that actually says that you shouldn't have slavery or child labour because all these are political, ethical judgments.|Ha-Joon Chang|Child, Political, Slavery

The American legal industry is a medieval guild in which the prosecutors, bar, and bench join hands to ensure that legal invoices are paid, no matter how excessive.|Conrad Black|American, Hands, Matter 
In the US, you even lose legal rights if you store your data in a company's machines instead of your own. The police need to present you with a search warrant to get your data from you; but if they are stored in a company's server, the police can get it without showing you anything.|Richard Stallman|Police, Data, Company 
Frivolous lawsuits are booming in this county. The U.S. has more costs of litigation per person than any other industrialized nation in the world, and it is crippling our economy.|Jack Kingston|World, Economy, Nation

Misery is the company of lawsuits.|Francois Rabelais|Company, Misery, Lawsuits 
One thing I know from personal experience, judges hate it when parties talk publicly about their cases. There are a lot of things about our criminal legal system that need to be changed, and this is just one of them. Prosecutors know how to play the press. Most defendants don't.|Michael Arrington|Experience, Hate, Know 
The increasing legal pressure against archives has created anxieties among researchers, librarians, and journalists.

What I'll say is that Cuban-Americans don't have to deal with the same immigration issues as other nationalities because of the 'wet feet, dry feet' policy. For Cubans, one year after you touch United States territory, you can become a legal resident.|Jorge Ramos|Feet, Immigration, You 
Every time anybody in Washington talks about legal status, amnesty, anything of that nature, it becomes a magnet that lures people in quickly into the United States.|Louie Gohmert|Nature, Time, People

I never thought I would live long enough to see the legal profession change to the extent it has.|Constance Baker Motley|Change, Thought, Long 
If the court strikes down the Defense of Marriage Act, is that a 'liberal' result enabling gay couples married in states where gay marriage is legal to enjoy the same economic advantages that federal laws now grant to straight couples?

King consciously steered away from legal claims and instead relied on civil disobedience.|Constance Baker Motley|King, Disobedience, Away

They seem to have forgotten that, and are back saying the only purpose of P2P networks is for illegal trading of owned goods. We claim part of the reason for P2P is for legal trading of what ought to be in public domain. And what is in public domain in many cases.|John Perry Barlow|Purpose, Saying 
The 'Total Information Awareness' project is truly diabolical - mostly because of the legal changes which have made it possible in the first place. As a consequence of the Patriot Act, government now has access to all sorts of private and commercial databases that were previously off limits.|John Perry Barlow|Changes, Government 
You see these casting directors' lists of characters, and they're all boxed in. Twenties is the hot girlfriend, thirties you can still be hot but moving swiftly to hot mum. Forties, you're the legal person in a pantsuit. Then, once you reach your fifties, you're positively elderly.|Thandie Newton|Moving, You, See

The legal principle placing the burden of proof on accusers rather than the accused can be traced back to Second and Third Century Roman jurist, Julius Paulus Prudentissimus. Yet, this ancient concept, which forms the legal and moral cornerstone of the American judicial system, is quickly being undermined in the name of 'national security.'|Bob Barr|American, Name, Moral 
Foreigners like me have no privacy rights whatsoever. Yet we keep using U.S.-based services all the time, making us a legal target for gathering and storing our private information. Other countries do surveillance as well. But nobody has the global visibility that United States does.|Mikko Hypponen|Time, Information, Me 
This is sort of typical Hillary Clinton: to do things that are not legal, to say that they are, and then try to cover them up. Hillary Clinton severely chastised other whistleblowers for using Internet channels that were not secure, and yet she herself was doing that with private, high-level State Department information.|Jill Stein|Internet, Information, She

If you come here illegally, and you commit a crime, you're not going to be able to stay in our country.|Ronna McDaniel|Strong, People, Think 
Despite the vigorous policy and legal debates surrounding same-sex marriage, there is little disagreement about this: If the United States Supreme Court holds that states must sanction same-sex marriage, then Florida's contrary laws must fall.|Pam Bondi|Marriage, Fall, Laws

The only people who benefit from lawsuits are lawyers. I think we made a couple of them rich.|Gavin Rossdale|People, Rich, Think

The Republican majority will stop at nothing to prevent access to the legal system for those who are hurt.|Joe Baca|Hurt, Nothing, Stop 
The situation around Terri Schiavo was a deeply held conflict over what to do if someone isn't going to return to consciousness or competence. Who will decide?

When I read a book I liked, I would get a pen and one of my father's legal pads and rewrite it from memory as if I had thought of it myself. It was a clear sign that I wanted to be involved in writing, even if it was just pretend at that point.|Jonathan Dee|Father, Myself, Memory 
I'm always writing something. There's always some structure sitting around someplace. There's always things on the computer, things scratched on score paper, legal tablets full of lyrics. It's never not buzzing around me all the time. I'm always doing it.|J. D. Souther|Time, Writing, Me 
I've always considered making it legal for Americans to import their prescription drugs a free-trade issue. Imports create competition and keep domestic industry more responsive to consumers.|Chuck Grassley|Competition, Create, Always 
If you have been vaccinated for polio, mumps, measles, chicken pox, hepatitis, or rabies, it may be too late for you to stand your ethical ground: You have already benefited from fetal-tissue research. This is, after all, a practice that's been legal since the 1930s.|Katha Pollitt|Research, Practice, Too Late 
Insofar as international law is observed, it provides us with stability and order and with a means of predicting the behavior of those with whom we have reciprocal legal obligations.|J. William Fulbright|Law, Behavior, Stability 
I'm not sure I can say there is a clean line between me as an individual and me as a lawyer.|Anita Hill|Lawyer, Me, I Can

In this life and death case, I felt Mrs. Schiavo should receive the fullest due process from our legal system.|Paul Gillmor|Life, Death, Life And Death 
And they didn't have to get into a lot of legal speak or talk ER terms, they were real people. I think that's why so many actresses were attracted to it. And it was just about problems that you could identify with so much, right off the bat.|James Denton|Problems, Speak, People 
My first ever sex scene in a movie was in 'Superbad.' Because I was 17, for legal reasons my mother had to be on the set. It was real awkward, but it worked out OK because when I watched the movie with her, the sex scene wasn't awkward because she'd been right there when it happened.|Christopher Mintz-Plasse|Mother, She, Her 
Once the Supreme Court in 1973 decided that infanticide could be legal, it not only ended America's 'inalienable right to life,' it threw the Golden Rule right off the shores of this continent.|Michael Moriarty|Life, America, Right 
I wish the government and the Minister of Justice would address these legal and constitutional arguments, but they refuse to. They want Canadians to go blindly into their brave new world, but it is not wise for a society to move blindly in any direction.|Stockwell Day|Justice, Wise, Government 
You need to find somebody who will speak the same language. We understand that we couldn't have any kind of discussion without permission, without a legal framework behind it.|Anatoly Chubais|Language, Speak, You 
Sooner or later they are going to live in a New York City where gay marriage is not only legal, but it's common and they don't even notice.|Anthony Weiner|Marriage, City, Live 
While I support immigration regulated through a legal framework, I do not support rewarding those who broke the law to get here.|Kit Bond|Law, Support, Immigration 
I oppose any attempt to grant homosexual unions the same legal privileges that civil government affords to traditional marriage and family life.|Todd Akin|Life, Family, Marriage 
I think that the proposed constitution is one of the European legal documents with the strongest social dimension I have seen since I began following European issues.|Jean-Pierre Raffarin|Constitution, Think, Social 
I think my dad did legal work for someone who had a Packard Bell 8088, and they couldn't pay him, so they gave him a computer. I was initially not allowed to touch it, but that didn't last long. I started tinkering with it, and there were many times I screwed up the computer.|Jeremy Stoppelman|Work, Long, Think 
A duped newspaper or magazine could contend that a fiction-spouting journalist obtained part of his salary via fraud, and use a criminal proceeding to try and recoup that money. Given the profession's notoriously low wages, however, it's probably not worth the publicity headache and legal fees. No news organization has ever pursued such a case.|Brendan I. Koerner|Money, Organization, Salary 
People have always heard voices. Sometimes they're called shamans, sometimes they're called mad, and sometimes they're called fiction writers. I always feel lucky that I live in a culture where fiction writing is legal and not seen as pathology.|Ruth Ozeki|Culture, Writing, People 
You can't just lecture the poor that they shouldn't riot or go to extremes. You have to make the means of legal redress available.|Harold H. Greene|You, Poor, Just

Ten thousand pounds is the legal value of a negligently taken life, of a child or a parent. A cold and somewhat mean-spirited calculation: you would do better if you slipped on a paving-stone and broke a front tooth.|Nina Bawden|Life, Value, Child 
I'm sauteing asparagus, Brussels sprouts,broccoli, some boneless, skinless chicken breast, some halibut. That's about it; that's all I'm allowed. That's what's legal for me to saute.|Ron Funches|Me, Chicken, Some 
Testimony should be a philosophical problem and not limited to legal or historical contexts where it refers to the account of a witness who reports what he has seen.|Paul Ricoeur|Problem, Where, Historical 
I'm afraid I talk a lot, too much, perhaps. I should have been a lawyer or a college professor or a windy politician, though I'm glad I am not any of these.|Tom Glazer|College, I Am, Lawyer 
So much business is based on the belief that we should do whatever we can within legal limits to make as much money as we can. Ben & Jerry's was based on values, and we try to operate a business that not just sells ice cream but partners with all our stakeholders - whether that's suppliers or customers - to bring about a more sustainable world.|Jerry Greenfield|Business, Money, World 
Lawsuits should not be used to destroy a viable and independent distribution system. The solution lies in the marketplace and not the courtroom.|Don Henley|Solution, Independent 
Food is like a legal drug. You can take 50 cents and walk into the store and buy a Twinkie and get high. And it's killing people.|Fat Joe|Food, Walk, People 
It is imperative that when thousands of selfless volunteers respond to those who have incurred the wrath of a natural disaster that legal liability need not be hanging over their heads.|Jon Porter|Selfless, Disaster, Natural 
Perhaps these Ten Commandments cases will be the turning point in the legal war against religion.|Cliff Stearns|War, Religion

As a private lawyer, I could bill $750 an hour, but I don't.|Jay Alan Sekulow|Lawyer, Private, Hour 
I wouldn't pretend to tell you we don't pay our lawyers well.|Jay Alan Sekulow|Lawyers, You, Well 
Our country was thereby saved from the consequences of its distracting individualistic conception of democracy, and its merely legal conception of nationality. It was because the followers of Jackson and Douglas did fight for it, that the Union was preserved.|Herbert Croly|Democracy, Fight 
I think people should have the legal right to hurt themselves without fearing that they're going to get locked up for doing so. But on a personal level, if someone I loved was hurting himself or herself in front of me, I would, of course, try to restrain them.|Chester Brown|Hurt, Me, People

To some lawyers, all facts are created equal.|Felix Frankfurter|Lawyers, Facts, Equal 
I began my legal career working for Byron White, the last Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court, and the only justice to lead the N.F.L. in rushing. He was one of the smartest and most courageous men I've ever known.|Neil Gorsuch|Justice, Men, Career 
I've learned that most of gay America is coupled up, or looking to be. No wonder gay marriage has such traction. So many of us are already in it, so of course we want the legal benefits.|Bruce Vilanch|Marriage, America, Looking 
A good lawyer is a bad Christian.|John Lothrop Motley|Good, Lawyer, Christian 
It is simply a fact that the birth rate of our illegal immigrants exceeds that of our legal residents.|John Linder|Immigrants, Birth, Fact 
I believe if an individual wants to join organized labor and work under a union contract, they should have the legal right to do so. At the same token, a person who does not want to work under organized labor and wants to work should have the ability to do so without the threat of having to join and having to pay dues to organized labor.|Paul LePage|Work, Believe, I Believe 
Everywhere among the English-speaking race criminal justice was rude, and punishments were barbarous; but the tendency was to do away with special privileges and legal exemptions.|Albert Bushnell Hart|Justice, Special, Race 
Disarming Iraq is legal under a series of U.N. resolutions. Iraq is in flagrant violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.|Jose Maria Aznar|Security, Council, Series 
In my view, targeted lethal force is at its least controversial when it is on its strongest, most traditional legal foundation. The essential mission of the U.S. military is to capture or kill an enemy. Armies have been doing this for thousands of years. As part of a congressionally authorized armed conflict, the foundation is even stronger.|Jeh Johnson|Conflict, Military 
Under well-settled legal principles, lethal force against a valid military objective, in an armed conflict, is consistent with the law of war and does not, by definition, constitute an 'assassination.'|Jeh Johnson|War, Law, Conflict 
Human-rights advocates, for example, claim that the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners is of a piece with President Bush's 2002 decision to deny al Qaeda and Taliban fighters the legal status of prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.|John Yoo|War, Decision, President 
While Taliban fighters had an initial claim to protection under the conventions, they lost POW status by failing to obey the standards of conduct for legal combatants: wearing uniforms, a responsible command structure, and obeying the laws of war.|John Yoo|War, Lost, Responsible 
Once the attacks occur, as we learned on Sept. 11, it is too late. It makes little sense to deprive ourselves of an important, and legal, means to detect and prevent terrorist attacks while we are still in the middle of a fight to the death with al Qaeda.|John Yoo|Death, Fight, Too Late

Today the people from my State of Tennessee would listen to this debate, or even talk about a reference to God on our money or in the Halls of Congress or in our Pledge and say, please, let common sense and logic win the day and prevail versus legal mumbo jumbo.|Zach Wamp|Money, Today, God 
A written constitution guides and directs the application of law in a way utterly unlike oral guidance. It reminds us that the certainty and consistency of legal application is essential.|Edwin Meese|Law, Constitution 
I think it's pathetic that a court of law cannot be in a vacuum of the legal system, without the influence of the public threatening to do great bodily harm to people and property. It's really a pathetic statement for our country.|Mark Fuhrman|Great, Law, Influence 
The Democratic Party looks at massive immigration, legal and illegal, as a source of voters.|Tom Tancredo|Immigration, Party, Looks 
The Republican Party looks at massive immigration, legal and illegal, as a source of cheap labor, satisfying a very important constituency.|Tom Tancredo|Party, Important

In regards to The Haunting, people compared it to the old movie, which is unfair. We didn't have the rights to the movie. I couldn't duplicate a single thing because that would have been legal infringement.|Jan de Bont|People, Single, Rights 
What I'm doing is writing stories about women who care about justice. They are women who think about the difference between right and wrong, what's legal and illegal, ethical and unethical, moral and immoral.|Lisa Scottoline|Women, Justice, Writing 
Truly I never thought of myself as writing legal thrillers, and I still don't think I do. I write stories about women.|Lisa Scottoline|Women, Myself, Writing 
The Singaporean government, which represents legal migrant workers in employment disputes and claims of exploitation, requires that they stay in the country until the disputes are settled. If they leave, their claims are closed.|Alan Huffman|Government, Country, Workers 
I also urge the Obama administration - both on its own and in cooperation with other responsible governments around the world - to use all legal means necessary to shut down WikiLeaks before it can do more damage by releasing additional cables. WikiLeaks' activities represent a shared threat to collective international security.|Joe Lieberman|World, Security, Cooperation 
The U.S. immigration system is the most generous in the world, providing each year more green cards for legal permanent residence with a clear path to full citizenship than all the rest of the nations of the world combined.|Jan C. Ting|Path, World, Green 
Literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.|Nelson Algren|Challenge, Humanity 
If we want to set and enforce a limit on immigration, we have to be willing to say no to would-be immigrants who look a lot like our own ancestors, not because there's anything wrong with them, but simply because admitting them would exceed our legal limit.|Jan C. Ting|Immigrants, Want, Look 
There is no quick fix for illegal immigration. But only when we achieve better control of our borders and better respect for our immigration laws can we give meaning to the discussion we need to have over reforming the numbers, categories, and procedures for legal immigration into the United States.|Jan C. Ting|Respect, Control, Meaning

Instead, California is one of only 10 states that provides in-state college and university tuition to illegal immigrants. That's grossly unfair to a legal high school student who moves out of California for a year, then returns to attend college.|Elton Gallegly|School, College, High School 
Consular cards were not designed to be identification and no treaty recognizes them as such. Legal travelers, visitors and long-term residents carried passports, visas or green cards for that purpose.|Elton Gallegly|Purpose, Green, Cards

There's a misconception about Barack Obama as a former constitutional law professor. First of all, there are plenty of professors who are 'legal relativists.' They tend to view legal principles as relative to whatever they're trying to achieve.|Jonathan Turley|Law, View, Principles 
I think it's very healthy to use journalistic and legal techniques to investigate the evidence for and against Christianity and other faith systems.|Lee Strobel|Faith, Healthy, Think

It was also my idea that the advisory committees of the Academy should replace the legal committees of the German Reichstag, which was gradually fading into the background in the Reich.|Hans Frank|Idea, Background, Replace 
So my own suspicion is that the attorney has stopped this prosecution because part of her defence was to question legality and that would have brought his advice into the public domain again and there was something fishy about the way in which he said war was legal.|Clare Short|War, Advice, Her 
Hitler never abandoned the cloak of legality; he recognized the enormous psychological value of having the law on his side. Instead, he turned the law inside out and made illegality legal.|Robert Byrd|Law, Value, Never

When I was at 'Newsweek' magazine - which, you know, this really sounds like I walked four miles in the snow to school - but I started at 'Newsweek' magazine in 1963, which was before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So it was actually legal to discriminate against women, and 'Newsweek' did.|Ellen Goodman|Women, School, Know

I think we Americans, of all people, understand the importance of a good, legal, constitutional framework as the basis of political life.|Paul Bremer|Life, Good, Political 
I've learned to accept the fact that my students are far too busy preparing for their own legal careers to care one bit about the off-campus antics of Professor Burke. I get the impression that my students are vaguely aware of my novels, but are at best mildly curious.|Alafair Burke|Best, Busy, Care 
When you look at the big issues post-9/11 in the United States, whether it's water boarding, warantless wire tapping, surveillance, Gitmo, black sites rendition, all of those have been legal. Nobody has gone to jail for those programs.|Matt Apuzzo|Water, Black, You

But you can count the dead bodies from alcohol, tobacco, and legal pharmaceuticals by the millions.|Jack Herer|Alcohol, You, Count 
It is curious that, with my somewhat antinomian tendencies, I should have gone to Trinity Hall - which was, and is, before all a Law College - and should thus have been thrown into close touch with the legal element in life.|Edward Carpenter|Life, Law, College 
I guess music, particularly the blues, is the only form of schizophrenia that has organised itself into being both legal and beneficial to society.|Alexis Korner|Music, Society, Blues

We're involved right now in some very significant legal battles and it would be the wrong thing for me to do to step out in the middle of those battles.|Bill Scott|Step, Me, Right

The people and the mindset that killed 3,000 of our fellow citizens on September 11 2001, would have killed not 3,000, but 300,000 if they could have or 3 million or 30 million. We need to do everything we can within our value systems and legal structures to make sure that doesn't happen.|Tim Pawlenty|Value, People, Mindset

To have the opportunity to lead the Solicitor General's office is the honor of a lifetime. As you know, this is an office with a long and rich tradition, not only of extraordinary legal skill but also of extraordinary professionalism and integrity.

I hope gay marriage will be legal in every state.|Mark Consuelos|Marriage, Hope, Gay 
We need to be discussing issues specifically to help the American people. And that would not include illegal aliens. These are people - I'm for immigration - legal immigration. I've been an immigration attorney. But people who have come to our country and violated laws, we should not be providing full health care services.|Joe Wilson|Health, American, Help 
The legacy of slavery comes from the sustained political, legal and economic effort to link permanently an entire group of people to poverty - and to mystify that systematic disenfranchisement by making up something called race, which could serve as a distraction.|Sarah Churchwell|Poverty, Effort, Legacy 
These are people - I'm for immigration - legal immigration. I've been an immigration attorney. But people who have come to our country and violated laws, we should not be providing full health care services.|Joe Wilson|Health, People, Care 
I used to want to be a lawyer, but I didn't want to have half my brain sucked out.|Max Walker|Brain, Lawyer, Want 
Being under the microscope meant I was never given any slack. I still managed to screw up plenty in life, mind you, but in the things I really cared about - the legal work, or the stories I was telling as a writer, or the office I built in government - I wasn't left a lot of margin for error. It's kept me driven.|Ronan Farrow|Life, Work, Government 
I've been working at performing for five years now. I've been working in Australia and Spain and England. When I was only 15 or 16, 1 was performing in bars; I could have had legal problems, but it's also the only way to get to know what music is all about.|Andy Gibb|Music, Problems, Know

There are obviously legal restrictions on what you can do on TV in the States, as there are everywhere.|Dave Rowntree|You, TV, Everywhere

In my book, I detail the critical information we obtained from al Qaeda terrorists after they became compliant following a short period of enhanced interrogation. I have no doubt that that interrogation was legal, necessary and saved lives.|Jose Rodriguez|Short, Book, Information 
We knew that if the photos of CIA officers conducting authorized EIT (enhanced interrogation techniques) ever got out, the difference between a legal, authorized, necessary, and safe program and the mindless actions of some MPs (military police) would be buried by the impact of the images.|Jose Rodriguez|Impact, Police, Military

About 10 years ago, in an effort to gain a better grasp on McCone's world, I took up the hobby of building fully electrified scale models: first of the legal cooperative where she started out, and then of her own brown-shingled cottage, a pursuit that the more tactful of my friends label unusual, and that the more blunt refer to as obsessive.|Marcia Muller|Friends, Effort, World

With 'GoldenEye,' the franchise got locked into this legal fight. They couldn't make new Bond movies for about seven years. It was my first huge production. I figured if I did at least a yeoman-like job, it would be greeted as a complete revival of the series.|Martin Campbell|Job, Fight, Movies

I would expect illegal alien parents to take care of their children. If it means the kids go back home with them, that's what happens.

I'm one of those people who has always been a bridesmaid.|Piper Laurie|People, Always, Been 
I see an insidious problem in the marketing of weddings as 'the happiest day of your life.'

I just wrapped this movie called 'The Wedding Crashers' which was a pretty big break for me.|Bradley Cooper|Me, Big, Break

I learned hard lessons in life; I had to because I had so much happen: My mother died my sophomore year in high school. The next year, same day, my brother dropped dead. Two years after that, I got married because my girlfriend got pregnant. The year after my wedding, my father - who I had only recently met - died.|Bernie Mac|Life, Father, Mother

Do I believe in coupling? Do I believe in commitment? Do I believe in co-parenting, raising children together, having a family, and growing old with someone?

I do love a good wedding.|Laura Wasser|Love, Family, Children 
Growing up, I was never the kind of girl to dream about wedding dresses and pretty houses.|Louise Nurding|Girl, Growing Up, Dream 
Somebody ripped their pants open at my wedding, dipping my mother. My mother is not a lady who throws herself into a dip that often, so I don't think he thought she was really going to do it.|Melissa McCarthy|Mother, Thought, Think 
I think the only consistent thing is that I like projects that explore different social themes. 'Our Family Wedding' is a comedy, but it deals with two different cultures coming together. It's also about people letting go.|Forest Whitaker|Family, Together, People 
I never wanted a big wedding. I never wanted to wear a white dress or throw a bouquet.|Taylor Jenkins Reid|Dress, White, Never 
I loved everything about my wedding look, but, in retrospect, I would have changed the position of where we attached the veil on my head. Make sure you test a few different placements and styles before the big day to make a clear vision and plan with your hairstylist.|Margherita Missoni|Day, Vision, Plan 
My wedding was at home, so I didn't really want to wear a veil in my house. Instead I wore a lot of diamond hair clips. They were brooches, actually, designed by Lorraine Schwartz.|Georgina Chapman|Home, Hair, Want 
It's very nice to be asked to anybody's wedding. Particularly if it's the Prince of Wales. I learned a lot from it, which was to end early and get away. I suppose one would have to look back historically and see who other royals had at their weddings. Were there people at Queen Elizabeth's wedding who were common like myself?|Jools Holland|Myself, End, Queen 
I am the center of attention in my job every single day the thought of a wedding to me is exhausting. Why would I put myself through that? |Lady Gaga|Day, Myself, Job

Narciso Rodriguez was my first fashion big brother. He made my wedding dress, which was wonderful.|Claire Danes|Brother, Dress, Fashion 
I think that weddings have probably been crashed since the beginning of time. Cavemen crashed them. You go to meet girls. It makes sense.|Christopher Walken|Time, Beginning, Think 
I've never crashed a wedding. When I was a kid I, of course, used to crash parties. Crashing a wedding is difficult though because you have to have the suit, and you have to have information in case someone catches you. You have to know at least some names and something.|Christopher Walken|Information, Know, You 
I've always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well. What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning. I didn't wait tables. I did calligraphy for the invitations for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton's wedding.|Meghan Markle|Job, Down, Wait 
I did calligraphy for the invitations for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton's wedding.|Meghan Markle|Like, Did, Robin 
So many little girls dream about their wedding day. But with actresses, sometimes it's the inverse, because we get to be the centre of attention, looked up and down, dressed up for premieres all the time. The pull isn't quite as great.|Natalie Dormer|Time, Day, Great

The white hot publicity that came from 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' was appreciated but not sought, so I was happy to walk away from it and then write.|Nia Vardalos|Happy, Myself, Writing 
I thought I was attractive when I shot 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.' Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them. In other words, they labeled me with words like overweight, unattractive, unappealing.|Nia Vardalos|Confidence, Words, Me 
It gave me a lot of pleasure and pride that 90 percent of the crew for 'Monsoon Wedding,' and most of my film, are women. We get the work done, you know, much lesser play of ego... And I really believe in harmony, I believe in working in a spirit of egolessness and that the film is bigger than all of us.|Mira Nair|Work, Women, Believe 
I used to love to create outfits, and I still do - I just don't have the time. How can you wear one thing and never wear it again? Even my wedding dress - I had a dress made that I could wear again. I'm a child of the depression, so I'm very, very practical.|Iris Apfel|Love, Time, Depression 
Seriously I suspected I was a good actor, though I didn't know it during 'Monsoon Wedding.' Now I realize the more I learn, the less I know about acting... and life.|Randeep Hooda|Life, Good, Acting

My favorite time to dance is at, like, wedding receptions, when it's all ages and everyone seems to be having fun.|Neil Patrick Harris|Time, Dance, Fun

I'm used to being in front of camera and knowing what to think. But if you're asking me to be me, I get very self-conscious. My job isn't to be me. Being an actor, people think you can do a eulogy at a funeral, a speech at a wedding. I find all that very nerve-racking.|Eddie Marsan|Job, Me, People 
I try to remember, as I hear about friends getting engaged, that it's not about the ring and it's not about the wedding. It's a grave thing, getting married. And it's easy to get swept up in the wrong things.|Gwyneth Paltrow|Friends, Easy, Remember

There was no relationship between a wedding dress and fashion. There was no good taste, either. I realized that I could make an impression in terms of changing and readdressing the whole industry of bridal.|Vera Wang|Relationship, Good, Dress

It's always great to have things from France at a wedding. It's symbolic of style, of culture, of taste.|Andre Leon Talley|Culture, Great, Style

When I got married in 1991, I had never been to a wedding, so I didn't know that my wedding was tacky. I didn't know that I was getting married in a quinceanera dress, because there was nobody there to cry over me and tell me I look like a fool.|Niecy Nash|Fool, Dress, Me

It took two months from the day my fiance proposed to my first Google search for 'wedding planning: how?' Now, let me interrupt myself here and share how much I hate using the word 'fiance.'

I am fully anticipating that something - perhaps many things - will not go according to plan on our actual wedding day. If some of the flowers are wilted, or there aren't enough vegetarian meals, or the priest calls me the wrong name, I will embrace these errors.|Ellie Kemper|Day, Flowers, I Am

My problem with the wedding industry started when I studied in college and liked to have the television on in the background, and 'A Wedding Story' on TLC always came on, and I'd get irritated that the story of two people making a lifelong commitment to each other could be encapsulated in a half-hour show about the party they throw.|Jessica Valenti|College, Commitment

I haven't made many wedding dresses. It's a dress very, very important for the girl; it's important to know the person, I believe, but at the same time it should be a shock to the person - the person should be shocked to be suddenly revealed. That's the work of a designer sometimes, to propose an ID of look.|Olivier Theyskens|Work, Time, Dress

A wedding, people decide to get married, it comes out of such love for one another and then women can turn into these other people.

People didn't just wear wedding dresses in the past. They also wore plain cotton shifts beneath them.

I had a 2-week courtship with a fellow student in the fiction workshop in Iowa and a 5-minute wedding in a lawyer's office above the coffee shop where we'd been having lunch that day.

I want John Legend to sing at my wedding.|Sloane Stephens|Want, Legend, Sing

'That's What She Said' is not Hollywood's standard picture of women: preternaturally gorgeous, wedding obsessed, boy crazy, fashion focused, sexed up 'girl' women. These are real women, comically portrayed, who are trying to wrestle with the very expectations of womanhood that Hollywood movies set up.|Carrie Preston|Women, Girl, Crazy 
I got my first big paycheck for 'My Best Friend's Wedding.' This was in the days when you actually did get paid to have a supporting role. It just doesn't happen like that anymore, but this was in the '90s. It was the golden age!|Carrie Preston|Age, Best, Friend

When I was in high school, there was 'Superbad' and 'The Girl Next Door' and 'Wedding Crashers' and all these great movies.

The first thing I ever saw Bradley Cooper in was 'Wedding Crashers.'|Ed Weeks|First, Ever, The First Thing 
I don't follow trends. I make each cake for a particular wedding, or event.|Ron Ben-Israel|Cake, Trends, Event 
When I celebrated my bar mitzvah, there was no cake. Today, there is no such thing as a bar mitzvah in the United States without a special cake.

On the night of the winter solstice, when the dead get their annual reprieve, they go up to the 24-hour donut shop and wedding chapel to get hitched.

When the Internet first came into public use, it was hailed as a liberation from conformity, a floating world ruled by passion, creativity, innovation and freedom of information.

We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way.

I think that what I have been truly searching for as a person, as a writer, as a thinker, as a daughter, is freedom. That is my mission.

We have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. 'America, land of liberty and freedom?' You know, that's baloney. More than 2 million Americans are behind bars now.

My Dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I like to think he'd be proud of me and my sister and brothers, because I'm sure proud of him and of where I come from, Janesville, Wisconsin.|Paul Ryan|Life, Sister, Me

And so my mind would just wonder about what else was out there.|Jason Clarke|Mind, Small, Step

My dad came from Cuba when he was a teenager not speaking English. And I grew up here speaking Spanglish. That's the world in which I grew up, and that's a world in which a lot of second generation immigrants find themselves.|Ted Cruz|World, Generation, Find 
My dad grew up with an avocado tree in his backyard. My entire family, my wife and daughters, they love avocado. I may well be allergic. It makes me physically sick.|Ted Cruz|Love, Family, Tree 
This is going to sound horrible, but I don't even know how much I make in a year. It must be, you know, a couple of million dollars, a few million. I know it's more money than my dad, a jail guard, made in his lifetime; more money than I'll ever need.|Penn Jillette|Money, Know, You 
I'm very at ease, and I like it. I never thought I would be such a family-oriented guy; I didn't think that was part of my makeup. But somebody said that as you get older you become the person you always should have been, and I feel that's happening to me. I'm rather surprised at who I am, because I'm actually like my dad!|David Bowie|I Am, Makeup, Me 
And I saw the sax line-up that he had behind him and I thought, I'm going to learn the saxophone. When I grow up, I'm going to play in his band. So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan.|David Bowie|Thought, Plan, Me

Dad entered the Second World War like any other man, trying to do the right thing.|Ridley Scott|War, Man, World

My father was the role model I looked up to. My dad was an entertainer, too. I patterned my life after him. He wanted me to do better than he did. He never sold a record in his life, but to me, he was still a rock star.|Tracy Morgan|Life, Father, Me 
My dad was good with actions.|William Shatner|Good, Actions 
My dad died of a stroke.|William Shatner|Stroke, Died

When I was 13, I opened my own business called The Awesome Pretzel Company, and my dad helped me build a pretzel cart.|Guy Fieri|Business, Me, Company

Now my dad is with me, traveling with me and a big part of this whole thing is I like to mix it up a little bit, you know.

I would say the dumbest thing I have heard is that my dad isn't my real dad.|Khloe Kardashian|Real, Say, Dumbest 
If your dad died before you were born, yeah, it hurts - but it's not like you had a connection with something that was real.

He was my superhero.|Jay-Z|Good, Better, You

My dad always used to encourage me to dress weird.|Charli XCX|Dress, Me, Weird

When I was a boy, my own dad told me in a smiling and wistful way that it's a wise man that knows his own father.|Michael Leunig|Father, Smiling, Wise

Our public portrayal of fathers has shifted during my life. TV fathers have 'evolved' from real people like Sheriff Andy Taylor, Beaver's dad Ward Cleaver and Heathcliff 'Cliff' Huxtable, to cartoon dads like Homer Simpson and Seth MacFarlane's caricatures in 'American Dad!' and 'Family Guy.'|Donna Brazile|Life, Family, American

When I was 13, I had my first job with my dad carrying shingles up to the roof. And then I got a job washing dishes at a restaurant. And then I got a job in a grocery store deli. And then I got a job in a factory sweeping Cheerio dust off the ground.|Ashton Kutcher|Job, Restaurant, Dust 
My dad was young; he went to work. But he'd been to war. He'd seen some of the world. It wasn't like he was going to be an extensive traveler or something.

My dad taught me to never be pigeonholed to really allow yourself to reinvent characters as they reinvent you to be bold and to be willing to play seemingly unlikeable people. |Laura Dern|Yourself, Me, People

My dad, he was a construction worker. He was a butcher. He was a deep sea fisherman.|Aisha Tyler|Deep, Sea, Construction 
I was raised by a single dad, and I've always kind of liked things that are typically more guy-oriented.|Aisha Tyler|Single, Kind, Always 
I was raised by a single dad. Dad's idea of hanging out with your kid or day care was give her $20 in quarters, drop her at the arcade, and tell her not to talk to strangers.|Aisha Tyler|Day, Care, Strangers 
My dad was a big Frank Zappa fan, so I remember listening to a lot of Frank Zappa. Girls do not like Frank Zappa.|Bill Hader|Listening, Remember, Big 
It's a complex relationship when your dad happened to be president and you are president and then you have all the amateur psychology that goes on when people try to speculate about motivations.|Jeb Bush|Relationship, People, You

I think it was hard at first for my dad to transition to being immobile.|Jeb Bush|Transition, Think, First

I remember in the fifth grade my dad would take me to Manhattan to shop for clothes.|Theophilus London|Me, Clothes, Remember 
The first time I went to New York, I went with my first boyfriend, Clark. His dad had just bought an apartment in New York, and my dad dropped us off, and we were there for a week on our own.

All that really matters is I have two beautiful kids, and I'm trying to be the best dad I can possibly be, and that's the most important thing of all.|Tiger Woods|Beautiful, Best, Trying 
When I started writing, I did have some idealised notion of my dad as a writer. But I have less and less of a literary rivalry with him as I've gone on. I certainly don't feel I need his approval, although maybe that's because I'm confident that I've got it.|Paul Theroux|Writing, Rivalry, Confident 
Overcoming my dad telling me that I could never amount to anything is what has made me the megalomaniac that you see today.|Bono|Today, Overcoming, Me

My dad always said that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard enough.|Katee Sackhoff|Work, Hard Work, Work Hard 
I didn't start sweating until I had children. That was one of the first things I realized when my daughter Violet was born - I started getting wicked BO.

My mother taught me what it is to have a sense of humour; my dad, who was a headmaster, everything you need to know about hard work. My dad is the most decent man you could come across.|James Nesbitt|Work, Hard Work, Mother 
I grew up upper-class. Private school. My dad had a Jaguar. We're African-American, and we work together as a family, so people assume we're like the Jacksons. But I didn't have parents using me to get out of a bad situation.|Beyonce Knowles|Work, Family, Parents

My dad designed houses and was an architect for many years.|Nikki Reed|Years, Houses, Many 
My dad was the way he was, but he also gave me a motto: never say die. Just to keep pushing and pushing, fighting until the end. He put it in my head that you're always going to fight, and you're always going to beat them.|Jason Day|Motto, Fight, Me

My dad has kind of been the standard for me, he played 16 years in the league, and since I've been in the league, every year that I go through and deal with the scratches, the bumps and bruises, just the grind that it is to go through one NBA season.|Stephen Curry|Me, Season, Grind 
But I have to be careful not to let the world dazzle me so much that I forget that I'm a husband and a father.|Herbie Hancock|Father, World, Me

My dad was a particularly polite kind of guy, very courteous.|Paul McCartney|Kind, Guy, Courteous 
When I first joined SAG, there was another John Reilly. My dad was John Reilly, too, but growing up I was John John. Nobody in life calls me John C. It's more like, 'Hey you, Step Brother!'|John C. Reilly|Life, Brother, Me 
I think I got into travelling because it was so not in my blood, so against my tendency to just stay put because my dad just hated going on holidays, because, as I've said in many essays, the thing that he hated more than anything else in life was spending money. And as soon as you leave your home, you're spending money.|Geoff Dyer|Life, Home, Money

My dad was a roofer when I was young. I believe he owned his own roofing company in Florida. And then he fell through a roof, broke his back. Permanently. I mean, he's not paralyzed or anything, but he's had to deal with pain for all of his life since then.|Channing Tatum|Life, Pain, Believe

I love the comic opportunities that come up in the context of a father-son relationship.|Harrison Ford|Love, Relationship, Context

We'd play this game of find Pluto or find Donald Duck. He'd read us stories and do all the voices. Those are great memories.|Danica McKellar|Memories, Great, Book 
But I honestly don't read critics. My dad reads absolutely everything ever written about me. He calls me up to read ecstatic reviews, but I always insist that I can't hear them. If you give value to the good reviews, you have to give value to the criticism.|Fiona Apple|Good, Value, Me 
I grew up with a truck. My dad had one, so I like trucks.|Lucas Till|Truck, Up, Like

My father, he was like the rock, the guy you went to with every problem.|Gwyneth Paltrow|Father, Problem, You 
I feel my dad, I still feel his love, and I still love him. I would do anything to have him back, but half the reason that my life is good, has real, true value, is that he died. I would obviously rather have him alive, but he gave me so much in his death.|Gwyneth Paltrow|Love, Life, Good 
I want to be a dad. That's floating to the top of my list. I think it's such an important thing. I'm at the age where everyone has kids, and I ask them, 'Is it like a puppy?' And they go, 'It's 10 times a puppy.'|Jimmy Fallon|Age, Want, Think

I want my kids to see me as Dad, for God's sake, not a television personality.|Gordon Ramsay|God, Personality, Me

My dad worked two jobs and moved us to the suburbs, and just being a black person, I went through a lot of racism and being called names and being bullied every single day. And it was hard. I didn't have any friends.|Sherri Shepherd|Day, Friends, Racism

My dad studies and practices homeopathy and Ayurveda medicine. He's a strong believer in both honey and milk as forms of healing. Honey is the one food that does not die. It does not expire.

I was always embarrassed because my dad wore a suit and my mother wore flat pumps and a cozy jumper while my friends' parents were punks or hippies.|Shirley Manson|Friends, Mother, Parents

My dad was in the military, yeah. He was in the Air Force, and he was a doctor, so he would go places for six months here, and two years there. And I was home-schooled because I played the violin, and I did a lot of competitions.|Felicia Day|Doctor, Military, Air Force 
When I turned 11, my dad decorated a room at the Standard hotel in Los Angeles in a '60s, Austin Powers style.

My father... had sharper eyes than the rest of our people.|Chief Joseph|Father, Eyes, People

They have had such a crazy life living with me as their dad. Not crazy but different from their friends.|Sebastian Bach|Life, Friends, Crazy

I watch political shows for a number of weeks in a row, and all I see are guys arguing with each other over issues I have no idea about. My brother, he loves war-torn places.

My dad wanted to name me after Rainier Maria Rilke, the poet.|Rainn Wilson|Me, Name, Wanted

And I'm pretty stubborn. I'm a lot like him. And he said, 'If you go to college and graduate, I'll pay your first six months of rent in Nashville.' So he bribed me.|Eric Church|Music, College, Me 
You can't be the dad who takes your kid out after your wife has said, 'No ice cream,' buys the ice cream, and says, 'Don't tell your mother.' You teach the child to lie - and to disrespect the other parent.|Howie Mandel|Mother, Wife, Child

My dad used to draw these great cartoon figures. His dream was being a cartoonist, but he never achieved it, and it kind of broke my heart. I think part of my interest in art had to do with his yearning for something he could never have.|Kathryn Bigelow|Art, Great, Heart 
When we used to go to the car-wash where people would wipe the windows, my dad would go out and help them and then tip them as well, so I learned my empathy from my dad, and my mum is very empathetic too, but in a very stern way; she will always check my ego.|Charlie Puth|Empathy, Help, Ego 
The surprising thing about fatherhood was finding my inner mush. Now I want to share it with the world.|Christopher Meloni|World, Want, Finding 
To do a movie with someone like Tom Hanks that when you tell your dad, your dad knows who Tom Hanks is - it feels like you're finally giving back to your parents. It's like you've actually done something that they can recognize, and there's something in me that makes them super proud.|Sarita Choudhury|Parents, Giving, Me 
My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn't know my dad very well.

My dad is really just lazy. He has nothing, I feel, to offer this world.|Sasha Grey|World, Lazy, Nothing

It is impossible to please all the world and one's father.|Jean de La Fontaine|Father, World, Impossible

Between Prince and my dad's fusion-jazz records, I didn't have a choice in being funky.|Patrick Stump|Choice, Funky, Records 
I look for strong people. I don't like people who'll say yes to everything I might bring up. I want people who can argue and disagree and have a point of view that's reflected in the magazine. My dad believed in the cult of personality. He brought great writers and columnists to 'The Standard.'|Anna Wintour|Great, Strong, Personality

To say that my dad pushed me is an understatement. I was never naturally drawn to football.|Thierry Henry|Football, Me, Say 
I never saw my dad cry. My son saw me cry. My dad never told me he loved me, and consequently I told Scott I loved him every other minute. The point is, I'll make less mistakes than my dad, my sons hopefully will make less mistakes than me, and their sons will make less mistakes than their dads.|James Caan|Son, Mistakes, Me

If I took the 40 years of my dad talking to me about war and battles and taking me to battlefields and distilled it down into one question, it would probably be the idea of the necessary or unnecessary war.|Suzanne Collins|War, Me, Down

Employee fathers need to step up to the plate and put their family needs on the table.|James Levine|Family, Step, Employee

My dad was an attorney. The last thing he ever thought about was clothes, and yet somehow he always looked good.|Thom Browne|Good, Thought, Clothes

I wanted to take up music, so my father bought me a blunt instrument. He told me to knock myself out.|Jay London|Music, Father, Myself

Since I stayed in a colony where either one was an engineer or a scientist, everybody thought I would be a scientist. This was the expectation everybody had apart from my parents.

I grew up in Greenwich Village. Dad was friends with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.|Yancy Butler|Friends, Village, Up

My father taught me how to substitute realities.|Mira Sorvino|Father, Me, Taught

I had to learn how to chop wood actually - I don't think my dad would have let me go chop wood in the backyard growing up.|Jennifer Lawrence|Growing Up, Me, Wood 
Can I play a southern character? You betcha. Can I do the voice of Tourist Dad and Carnival Barker? Ya betcha. Can I do Fix-It Felix? Ya betcha.

He said, 'Son, that is where you need to go.'|Robert Pattinson|Son, Restaurant, Drama

I look at my little girl and I wonder what she's going to be and what she's going to do and what is it that leads girls certain directions in life.

Roman history was kind of unavoidable where I was growing up. It was everywhere - all the place names and ruins and forts. My dad's a history buff, and I spent a lot of time on Hadrian's Wall.
